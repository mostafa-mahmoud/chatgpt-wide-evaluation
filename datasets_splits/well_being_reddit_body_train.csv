But the thought of my hair going away is equally as terrifying, I just don’t know what to do, and I’ve been to multiple dermatologists and the answer is mixed. Secondly, the courses that I’m taking are driving me nuts, they’re both incredibly hard and the stress of the work, tests, and maintaining a good mark is driving me nuts.

I just never excelled in it in any way and here I am with a masters degree and I’m just sitting around hopeless with no where to be or go or do in my career. Like I knew from the beginning that you don’t go into music for money but go into it for passion but it doesn’t even fulfill and sense of passion that I thought I once had. I did my undergrad in piano and played fine enough but not good enough to pursue any sort of anything on piano and finished my masters degree in composition just hating every piece of music I’ve written. I feel like I came out on the other end of this degree just more aware that I’m not a competent musician. I have zero desire to pick up an instrument and truthfully I’ve been thinking about donating them to my undergrad university becuase they’re just gathering dust here. I don’t enjoy practicing and I can only play a few pieces worth hearing. And out of all the music I’ve written, I don’t think I’m proud of any of it. I can’t even listen to music anymore without feeling a sense of failure towards my musical career.

It's hard to eat, my diet is restrictive, it hasn't helped, I'm young and healthier than most .. This is bullshit I'm on the strongest meds they have to suppress acid (PPI).

I know it can transform my life and it's what my heart is dying for but I need this to get fixed I don't know how to stay positive here anymore.

I feel like a crazy person, no one ever talks about this shit. 13. Critical thinking is rare. (Should be standard in 2021) 14.

I know that it's stress and not something more sinister because the first two times it happened, I was extremely stressed, and I went to my doctor, who could find nothing wrong with me, physically. The pain in my abdomen, while I know is not harmful, still freaks me out. It occurs on the right side, and is often low, which of course makes me jump right to appendicitis. Then I start hyper focusing on that and stressing myself out more, which in turn makes the pain worse, it's a pretty vicious cycle. I am currently on medication for GAD, but it doesn't seem to be doing much to help. I have a doctors appointment in a week and a half and plan on speaking to her about maybe switching medications, but is there anything that I can do to manage my stress until then?

I wanted to answer honestly because I do a lot of the time after some of the turns my life has taken, so I said ""Yes."" Then the nurse looked at me and prompted me to take my answer back and change it to ""No"" by telling me that if I say ""Yes"" that means like suicidal and I guess would be something they'd have to report. The fact is, I do think about suicide. I mean I've never acted on it, but it's not like the thoughts don't cross my mind. I just don't understand how we draw this firm, clear line between ""normal"" people and ""depressed"" people, and then if you outwardly manage your depression well enough, they look at you like you're crazy for saying you are depressed. Even worse is that some caring, well-meaning person probably had the question added to the triage process in the first place, but then in actual practice the person asking the questions pushes you to not answer the question honestly. What is the point of even asking the question if you are just going to push people that experience depression and manage it the best they can to lie and say they don't?

76,"I see depression being regarded as a monster, a beast, a fight, and a crushing weight. And I too, for many years, viewed it in those ways. It was hard and at times I felt as I could not ""escape"". One day at my absolute lowest. I decided to change my perspective on it just to see if it would even make a difference. Boy did it. For me, I looked at it like an amusement park and roller coasters. You can sorta guess how this goes, but please allow me to explain Walking through the park, at that level, we feel our baseline ""normal"". The rides represent our mental and emotional highs and lows in life. Everyone walks through the park. For some, that's all they do and they are content. Others get on the gentler rides. They experience both highs and lows but not to extremes, again still content. Then there are the coasters. Many people get on them and then never again. Others, keep riding their favorite one. For me? I was the one rushing between all of them. Running through the park to catch the next. Not staying in my baseline for very long. My depression shared a relationship with those roller coasters. Never staying the same and some bigger or scarier than others. Seeing the highest points between the drop of pure passionate joy. The lows with twists and turns leaving me in fear. And then returning to the station filled with gratitude that it's over safely. But here's were I saw beauty in this...My life is PASSIONATE. Those high points I feel so deeply. Those lows as well. But it's exhilarating through it all. And I know I'll return to the station safe and sound. Bringing friends and family to share in the beautiful moments and hold your hand through the scary. Recognizing my support system that way feels wonderful. And let's not forget therapy or medication (Personally unmedicated but open to it). I look at them like other riders. Especially ones you just can't help but laugh or giggle at when they are over the top or cracking jokes. They help make those fearful moments really not so bad.

So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after. Edit I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem. That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out.",1,well_being_reddit_body

141,"I'll try and keep this short and sweet. It's been six months since we took in our girl and almost from the outset, we had every intention of fully adopting her. Sure me and her had our differences, mainly because of me and bottling up my emotions over a tragedy we suffered years prior, but I've started seeing her as my daughter now and we're closer than ever. During this time, we've had visits from our agency that come and conduct wellness checks on both the living conditions of the house and also to see how we're doing, especially her. And every time it's gone smoothly and perfectly, at least for their requirements. So we had another visit from them today and this was what we anticipated most. It was just more paperwork to be submitted to the court as well as an official Petition to Adoption that we needed to finally complete. While me and my wife were doing this though, one of the other agents sat with our daughter privately to just talk and ask how things were going, if she genuinely wanted to stay with us, anything bad that was happening that we weren't telling them, etc. And at the end, they brought her back in and said that now, all that's left is for them to submit everything to the court for a judge to review. They said that hopefully we should expect a response within 30 days but oftentimes it's sooner depending on how clean the background check is and a few other things. ""We're almost there"" she (our agent) said. It's funny because our daughter, while she was extremely happy with how everything was going, wasn't nearly as filled with joy as me and my wife were. My wife was actually crying and couldn't contain herself. She nearly smothered her in her arms giving her a bear hug. I hugged her too and just looked her dead in the eyes and said ""We're almost there baby girl"" before kissing her forehead. I mean I just don't know what to say or how to say it at this point. This is like a dream come true with everything we've lost but also have gained so much more in the process. It breaks my heart thinking about how many other kids her age or around it (she's 14) are out there but will never have a permanent home like she will.

My wife went to enrol on her college course today and did so only for a few hours later the college to basically pull the plug on this plan by denying us the funding for childcare that we need for her to be able to attend her course. We are on benefits here in the UK as she raises our little boy whilst I go out and work full time as a teaching assistant so on low wages. I'm enrolled on an open university masters that starts in October and she was going to go and do hairdressing at college. This was supposed to be the start of us working our way out of the not so great financial situation we have. In a few years I would have my masters and be able to pursue a career working with children like I've always wanted to that earns me far more money than I currently do. My wife was going to be able to do her dream of being a TA for the part time hours most TA jobs offer and be a hairdresser on the side to earn a bit more money for us. This was going to be the better life we had always wanted and always wanted for our two children and allow us to have a third if we wanted one. But the college pulling the plug has just crushed us both. Her because it means she can't do the course she wants to do and better herself the way she wants to. And me because it feels I've sunk into this rut of thinking that whenever we try to look forward and be optimistic and things seem to be going well for us it all comes crashing down around us and falls through. I can't shake this feeling that no matter how positive and optimistic we can get, it's always going to fall apart.

(tho the culprit really is just being in a human society lol) I feel isolated and alone. I've opened up to a few people but I always end up sounding like a broken record and people say the same shallow things to console me. So I just stopped talking to the people around me about feeling depressed. My depression has led me to quitting my job; trust me, I wasn't far from getting let go. So I quit before it got real bad. I worked in a creative industry and the burnout feels permanent. And I struggle to make money. Freelance pays so little, and I'm living off my life savings, which is not much. Plus my art isn't even doing well. My works are ignored, or even if I get a commission or freelance project, I get paid less than minimum wage. I've learnt to say no and I do negotiate my rates but the desperation has caused me to just do what I can to stay afloat. I'm almost 30, so being a crybaby about it just paints myself as immature to those around me. Never gonna be able to afford a house, car, kids. I don't have the capacity to handle most jobs. But I did try my best before this. Most days I have sleep and tears for dinner. I always forget to shower and brush my teeth. My partner is stuck overseas indefinitely, so I've lost my strongest support system. The pain and loss I feel on a daily basis is unbearable. Some days I wish I had the guts to just end my life, but instead I just wallow in my own sadness and filth. I don't even know what would make me happy, or at least dull the pain a little. Maybe some company and a bit of help here and there would make it a bit better, but I know I'd still feel dead inside. And therapy? I can't afford it. Plus I know how therapists console people. I'm sure some of you relate to that thing you do where you have a rebuttal for every advice given... I've been the therapist friend, only just speaking from experience.

Lately keeping up with all this has gotten harder. Throughout my life it has been a series of crazy events and most of my life has been me going through depression even in my childhood years. I didn’t grow up in a healthy environment, I lost the person who helped raise me and who I saw everyday, am sleeping in his room, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship my high school to college years and now I should be happy. I was content before but I don’t know what happened. I talk to my boyfriend about it and I smoke weed all the time, I’ve grown addicted. I smoke to escape reality. I feel terrible. I feel like a terrible person and I get mood swings all the time. My boyfriend absolutely loves me and he urges me to get therapy and I want to. Especially because I want this relationship to work but most of all I just want to be happy for once. I am constantly negative and overthinking and I cry a lot, some days I feel like a different person. I want to seek therapy but I don’t have money, I’m broke. I’m not asking for anything but I don’t know where to go. I ask my mom to help me find therapy and she doesn’t take me seriously, even though years ago I had a suicide attempt and she dragged me to a therapist in which I denied help. But now I want it. What are the first steps to finding a good psychologist, how do I know what type to look for, how do I get a diagnosis, and does the fact that I have insurance help?

179,"Sorry in advance for any mistakes, English is not my first language! For as long as I can remember Christmas has always been a time of very intense feelings for me. I've always felt the Christmas holidays to be an overwhelming and stressful period of time, basically the exact opposite of what holidays are supposed to be like. My parents also reinforced this by making the Christmas stuff last for days. By this I do not only mean the actual celebration, but also the seemingly endless time you have to spend with the same people over and over again, including the same old political arguments and the forced gatherings of relatives you literally NEVER (have to) see except for this time of the year. Even without all this family stress, Christmas itself, the beginning of a new year and also my birthday (also happening at the beginning of January) are times, when I feel low no matter what happens. I always feel like I haven't even nearly accomplished as much as I'd like in my life and I've never even once in my life felt as happy as you probably should feel for Christmas or your birthday. I feel like there's this mutual agreement all over the world, that this is the time of the year, the time of your life and simply the time, where you should feel best and some magic miracles happen and your life upgrades itself to next level. (I know it's unrealistic and probably an unhealthy way of thinking, but it seems like subconsciously this thought is stuck with me.) This whole thing stresses me out intensely every year, but this year it's especially bad or maybe it's been that bad the years before and I just pushed it out of my mind. The point is, it's gotten to me physically and I've had a cold for basically a month now and the last few days, my back's been extremely stiff and sore, which is something that usually never happens. I'm panicking intensely even thinking about going home to my parents' place for Christmas next week and I don't know to get through these days/weeks, without feeling like I'll go insane any minute. I hope this is the right sub for this problem and I appreciate you reading this far and if you have any tips for making Christmas a bit easier even better )",1,well_being_reddit_body

I almost died and no one cared, so why even bother trying to better myself anymore? Have no friends and no family. Ever since my best friend and sisters died, I've felt alone. But no one in my family have showed any support and that makes me feel even lonelier. I used to have such faith in everyone, now I can't stand humanity.

Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to...... Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er. The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.

When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion.

225,"Fear is the expectation of displeasure in the widest sense! In the narrowest sense , fear is aversion of death.

When a man fixed on any fearful idea life becomes hell, and it feels no one understands what this man is dealing with .. all of us have been in fearful situations but some people are daily living this hell, Among the common fears people told me about - fear of rejection is big, when someone feels that no matter how he or she tries will be rejected, so the person becomes his own rejecter and he always pull himself back . - fear of abandonment a person with this fear he or she always pushing away people for his life because he has doubts about why people interested in him and he has shame persona based. - fear of success there's some people no matter what effort they take, they always fail because they fear Being successful that means unconsciously to them success is bad and dangerous. - fear of intimate relationships a lot of people are dealing with sexual shame without being aware of that, intimacy means pain and danger. - fear of oneself that's when a person is escaping himself all the time relying on drugs or some form of escapism such like porn.

I've always had anxiety issues and will literally not sleep or eat until a problem is at least subdued if not resolved. Yet I've also been very very adept at avoiding nonsense and misery in general. All up until this year. It started with covid making life a bit difficult. We a share that issue though. A bit later in the year a very close family member attempts suicide and that alone brought so many issues that lasted a few months. After that episode my 8 year old cat, my best little dude ,passed away due to severe anemia, and i spent 3k of my savings trying to save him.. Now i have what potentially could be a blood disorder ,if not possible (maybe future) leukemia. Family members have had that shit.. I've slept maybe 10 hours in the last 3 days.

I have had social anxiety for a few years now and I don’t care how painful death is, it’s better than the torture this is. (Sorry if that sounds cringe) Due to the social anxiety I have no social connections of any type outside of my single mother. I haven’t gone through anything bad in my life, but I don’t think you really need a justification for killing your self other than it is what I have chosen to do. If my social anxiety went away I would want to live to the rest of my life, but it is impossible to get rid of (yes I’ve tried medication and therapy. It’s become really painful seeing my old freinds continue to move on with their lives while I’m here alone with no life. I just can’t handle another day of this and the only way forward is suicide.

237,"We’re told that if we want to be happy, we need to exist in the present moment - but what does that actually mean? One helpful way to think about it is living through your senses - what you can perceive right now. As humans we have many senses (a lot more than five!) and we can use these to pull us back from worries about the future and regrets from the past. Take drinking a cup of tea or coffee as an example. We can - Listen to the kettle boiling - Look at the colour if the drink and the mug that its in - you’ve probably seen it 1000 times but you can look at it with beginners mind as if you’ve never seen it before - Feeling the warmth of the cup in your hands - Smelling the tea before you drink it - Noticing the taste / flavour - Feeling it pass down our throat There are many more perceptions for us to focus on. By tuning in to these we ground ourselves in the present moment, we calm ourselves and we can draw happiness from our everyday lives. Applying this awareness to your morning tea or coffee is an easy way to start to integrate awareness of the here and now into your life.

243,"I was reading a post that reminded me of a certain conversation I had with a fellow student back in 7th grade. I was in a lab group with three other kids and this guy who was insanely smart and always cracking jokes rolls up his sleeves. He's got all these scars on them and so another girl in the group asks about them. He just casually tells us he has a cutting problem. His parents had to confiscate knives and things. The rest of the group kind of just was like, ""OK wow that's scary"" and then we just did the assignment. I feel like I missed an opportunity there to help someone out. This guy just opened up about something so personal, and I sort of just was shocked and confused so I didn't comfort him and I didn't say anything touching or kind back. Honestly, I think I just couldn't process it. Was he joking? For me at least, lots of people joked about depression and suicide all the time in middle school. It had never occurred to me that some of these people actually felt that way. When I think back on the whole interaction, I realize I would never have known the internal struggle this guy had even existed if I didn't just happen to be in his lab group and he just happened to roll up his sleeves. I'm also really bothered by the fact that no one was concerned in the group, including myself. Another thing that severely bothers me is the fact that this was middle school. I feel like that's so crazy young and the reality that kids were already facing so much pressure and stress forces me to seriously question what the heck is going on in society right now. The main thing that this has taught me is that you seriously never know what someone is going through. I would never have guessed that this kid hated themselves like that. He was so smart (I kind of was jealous at times) and he made the wittiest jokes 24/7 and he was always smiling. I don't know what has happened to him.

275,"Being in full control of it opens us up to receive the infinite cosmic energy from the universe. Did he just say infinite? Yes, and you can see how this energy truly is by noticing how every second we get a new opportunity to change our state of being, point of view, and mental state. Child hood traumas, events that happened or even words that were said a long time ago, can hurt and carry through into our adulthood. Robbing us of our aliveness and spontaneity. There is a tendency to store the energy of an unresolved trauma by locking it in the body. Even if the situation happened only once, an unreleased and unresolved trauma can become trapped within the body and its energy field, causing tension, stress and possibly disease Releasing this stored, suppressed or blocked energy is a healthy, natural process that allows a person to resolve issues and to become more alive. One simple method to release this energy is by clearing it from your meridians (channels through which flows energy)((Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force.))

I know I shouldn't have been doing that but that's honestly not important to me right now, sorry. While grabbing the jar of gummies, I found a note right next to it. The note reads as a letter that my mom wrote to her mom (who passed away about 15 years ago). the TLDR of the letter is that my mom wished she knew the things she knows now as a parent when she was younger because she never appreciated how hard her mom worked for her. She went into how she thinks she failed me because of my depression (I'm open with my depression to my mom and she is supportive) and that being a parent is hard but she's trying her best but her best isn't enough. My mom has never spoken to me about her depression, although she has mentioned it very briefly, but reading that letter broke me harder than anything I can remember. I just started bawling, still am while writing this. My mom is the most important thing to me in the world and learning that she thinks she is a failure makes me have suicidal thoughts because of how broken I feel about this. But now I feel the pressure of making my mom proud and making sure she feels like she isn't a failure, so obviously suicide is off the table, at least until after she passes.

After I got out, I was seeing a regular therapist however I was stuck in a toxic job that kept on triggering my depression and fucking up my recovery. Found a promising new job but that one ended up being even more toxic. Met my current bf at that time and he convinced me to quit and it was the only job I ever rage quit and told the people to fuck off. Felt good. Ended up being a great choice because I decided to get my CDL and it's been awesome so far. Really got my shit in gear, the job is fun as hell, I make really good money, it's challenging in all the right kind of ways where you get these little senses of accomplishment here and there. Me and my bf also have a home together and it's great. But back to my point about staying on your treatment. Sometime inbetween going from the one toxic job to the other, I stopped seeing my psychologist. I was losing my health insurance at the time but I was on such a high from getting this new job it didn't bother me. Long story short, went through that hole toxic episode and a severe down but I blamed it on the job and not the depression. Once I got my CDL I was actually feeling happy and great. Depression is an asshole though and knows how to creep back in. Now that I've been driving semis for close to 2 years, the job has gotten very routine and I started falling back into old thought processes, the ones were all familiar with. They start slow like a dropping pipe until the pipe eventually bursts so you really don't notice it. But they're there. That one small familiar though eventually grows routes until you relapse like I did and youre back in that dark place with no escape. That's where I'm at now, gotta almost start from 0 again. Luckily, I have much more control on it and know what to do but still, this is something you truly got to actively manage everyday even when you don't feel you need to because it will creep back up at some point.

Which is half true it hurts but I at least give her something like right now I’ve been doing better on give her some money so she can buy herself something or when I bought her pans because she needed pans. But this week I failed for her birthday because i didn’t willingly offered to buy the cake or pay a whole lasagna (because my dad kept asking how much he owes me so I said we can split the check however that was wrong because it was a test if I was willingly going to offer in paying the whole meal) that my mom wanted. They say I’m cheap but I always buy stuff that my family likes even though yeah hurts me but if they want it I will buy it. Right now I guess this is me just to vent. I don’t know what to do to prove to my parents that I’m not cheap and that I have been buying stuff willingly for my mother. My father says I still have Mother’s Day and Christmas to do it correctly I guess. But for today my moms birthday I got her a necklace that said mom and a birthday card. It stresses me out because they say that I haven’t changed but I feel like I’ve doing very small baby steps in changing this bad characteristic of me but they expect me to drastically change because I guess it’s a habit that they never taught me to break at a young age. I don’t think I’m a penny pincher but I know it hurts when my bank account goes down but I mean I know my mom would do the same for me in buying stuff that I would like. I’m horrible with presents and sometimes I wish my mom could give me strong hints in what she wants and give me an idea what to give her.

I'm suffering from burn-out symptoms and have a fear of failing (idk is this has a name), especially when it comes to school. I am currently only doing 2 subjects, maths and chemistry, so that next year I can go to university. Its been almost 2 years since I started having burn-out/stress symptoms. I cry alot, get stressed by tiny things. So when I make a mistake in my calculations in maths or something, it is possible for my to start crying and have a semi-panick attack. I am seeing a psychologist so I am getting some help. But at home it is different, I still live with my parents and lil sister. My mum tries to help by saying, ""oh its only two subjects no need to worry, dont be so stressed"" and other quotes like that, my dad does the same. But this is only making my fears and stress worse, it makes me feel like I am being silly for feeling like this and not good enough for these subjects. When I tried talking to my mum about it she told me that she cant help it if I am interpretatting it negatively and that I shouldnt think like that and she got a bit mad. I just said ""okey"" as I didnt know what to do and felt now worse than before. My stress has gotten so bad now that sometimes I have a semi-panick attack over minor things, like talking to strangers, when my parents tell me to do something, small changes in my schedule etc. Now we (me and my family) are going on vacation soon and I'm getting really stressed about it because my tests are really short after and when I try to tell my parents how stressed I am they just start again with the oh its only two subjects thing and get a little mad when I say I dont want to go with them. All this has brought some tension between me and my parents and I really dont know how to talk with them about this anymore. Everytime I start thinking about it I start crying and all that.

Before moving I thought I was intelligent as I was one of the smartest in my year. With good enough GCSEs I moved to this school doing Maths, English, Economics and History for A levels.

Pure selfishness, no patience for understanding, no time for studying without prejudice, standard set spoiling the mind of some destroying the whole experience of life for all. If most of you died today you wouldn’t know what the truth is because you spent more time trying to ignore it, rather than accepting and trying to fix it. Because it’s just easier to let it all play out that way in your head. Put yourself in other people’s shoes. Care for others. Show appreciation. Protect those who need protecting. Accept the truth. Deal with it. Improve, then live your life with a mind wide open, and with eyes that can actually see.",1,well_being_reddit_body
356,"And this compounds the depression. Not only is childhood trauma (one in which your parents - who *should* have represented all that was good - were in fact, evil) one of the worst possible causes of depression - but the fact that nobody gives two shits other than telling you ""get over it,"" or ""seek help."" As if trauma is expected, but not ignoring it is not expected. You're supposed to conform to this place; to accept trauma as normal, if not something you *do*, normally. And so you get even more depressed about the fact that nobody understands what it's like to be depressed.",1,well_being_reddit_body

398,"Hi everyone, My (31M) girlfriend (28F) of 4 years suffers from depression and she's currently going through a rough period. I have never understood depression and I have accepted that I never will so I just try to be as supportive as I can with information from places like this subreddit. However, one question that I've always had and was afraid to ask why can't she own up to it? She is currently going through tough times. These days, she does not feel love for me (or anyone else) and is completely miserable. This is something that I can accept as being depression. But why can't she just say something like ""I know that I love you, even though I don't feel it."" or ""Thank you for taking care of me, I know this must suck for you""? She could even say ""I know I don't feel grateful right now but rationally, I realize that you are amazing for taking care of me"". One small sentence like that would mean the world to me and I can't imagine that she does not realize this. I hope this post won't be interpreted the wrong way. She is struggling with something horrible and I am complaining about wanting some compliments on the internet, but some days I feel like I can't take this anymore. Thank you to anyone who reads this.

I literally was eating and saw my puppy sleeping, and I immediately said ""wow he's depressed isn't he"" when he's just SLEEPING. I went out to get food, totally fine, no problem. As soon as I got home it hit me again with all the stuff I have to do. The pandemic has 1000% affected my mental health especially recently, where I don't get any enjoyment of stuff at home because I am always in front of a damn computer screen. I used to see home as a place to leave behind stress from school, and now I see home as the place where I do everything and there's no distinction between relaxing and school.

432,"I feel like these screens are more harmful than we realize. As we’ve turned to them during this global lockdown for a way to connect to people safely, I feel another trend has arisen and that’s the negative effects that these screens have on our interactions. Demand People expect you to be available at the drop of a hat, because they know you’re currently glued to your phone. Hyperbole aside, I make sure my phone migrates from room to room with me. For work, for emergencies, it doesn’t stray from my side. That doesn’t mean I owe anyone an immediate answer. Distance You can type things you wouldn’t dare say out loud. (Like what I just typed about not owing anyone an immediate response.) Because you can’t see the persons face, you are less in tune with their reaction and therefore less concerned about the effect your words will have. Curating Interactions Because it’s not instant, you have time to craft your response. That means the exchange of texts or emails when it resembles a conversation is a highly curated interaction in which each participant can choose how long they take to perfect their response. While this should promote clarity in that you can take your time to gather information and respond, it actually means people have time to manipulate answers. Intentional “On Read” There can be an effect to silence. Sometimes silence speaks. Think about a pregnant pause in natural conversation that lets you know someone is thinking... When we can use the screens between us to ignore someone, to be silent, sometimes that’s louder than outright hostility. Concluding my list as I write this at 00 38, I was up having these thoughts and letting them run their course hoping they would serve the same purpose as counting sheep. No luck.

He didn't ask if I was working for some association, who the young ones I was supervising were, nothing. He didn't even wait for giving the money when everyone was present. He just made this selfless act and departed. On the way back we bought everyone ice creams and I ended the day with a really great feeling.

445,"Few years ago I was living in a country where I was harrassed in the streets everyday. I was beaten up, spited on, insulted and touched by men. Since then, even if I moved, I still feel a high stress everytime I need to go out. It's ridiculous. Even if I know that I'm safe here, I feel stressed as soon as I open my eyes in the morning. When I need to go to work or to an appointment, I'm stressed to the point I feel like throwing up and cry. My digestive organs are getting more and more damaged and I started to get heart problems too. I've met many psychologists but it didn't help.

446,"Don't know if this is the right place for this, but I've searched other subs and this seems like the best place to me. I've been through a lot of stress and maybe some undiagnosed depression in the last two years, between the death of a close loved one, job and financial stress, severe relationship problems, health issues, and a bad living situation. I existed just to go to work where my coworkers helped me de-stress and laugh, but slept until I had to leave and came home just to get in bed again. I'm a creative person with a lot of drive to make things, and this used to give me a lot of purpose in my life, but during this time I'd stopped doing almost anything but watching comedy specials on TV. I was finally on the upswing of all that and feeling more like myself, and finally got back into my writing, which is my passion. But my stress threshold is still fucked up so when, in March, I felt forced to quit my sewing job over a heated argument/fight with my boss, it broke me again. Not as bad as last year, but I lost the routine I'd just settled into, and most of the writing drive I had I've lost. I worked there for six years and had a strong role and responsibilities that I had integrated as part of my identity. That job felt like ""who I am"". I had a comfortable, lax second job already that's now my main income and I'm fine there, and once again starting to come back out of that darkness. I'm able to do some crafting in bed but still spend most of my time with the TV on. I'm also getting a gentle morning routine going and that helps. But the big problem is my creative drive. I WANT to create things. I'm investing money in a voice recording set up and I want to narrate, and write and read. I'm wasting time cross stitching for hours every night while I binge shows I don't really care about. When I have perfect chunks of time to do the things I crave getting back into, the motivation isn't there. How do I do it? How do I get back into things I love when I've finally reached the other side of the stress? And, how do get myself strong again after so much, so that the next thing to come along doesn't break me all over again?",1,well_being_reddit_body

Besides my study demanding a lot of time, energy and effort, it definitely doesn't help that I have to force myself to work extra because I'm broke. Another thing that doesn't help is that I haven't seen my long distance partner in almost a year. Since this school year started I've been under non stop stress. In November I felt like I was extremely close to a big breakdown and potentionally a burnout, but I somehow managed to dodge that bullet. Since that I've been trying to fake it until I make it, except it's getting really hard now to pretend that everything is OK. Last semester I barely passed my exams (which disappointed me, I always aim to get good results and I get disappointed and feel guilty when I don't). The last exams of this year are coming up, next to that I have 5 other deadlines and an internship to finish, all in 2 weeks time. Every morning I wake up in sheer panic trying to remember what day it is to get myself mentally prepared for deadline stress, study stress, work stress or performance stress. Sometimes a combination of two, three or all of them. I don't even know if this was the right place to post it, but I had to let it out somewhere. I don't feel comfortable opening up to my parents and my partner doesn't seem to understand me very much when it comes to these type of things.

Sometimes when I talk my mind suddenly blacks out and I have no idea what to say next, or totally forget what should I say. I struggle with basic math problems.

452,"Just wanna find a vent I’ve always been the all A’s student at my school and everyone has so much expectations on me. I’ve always have this cheerful bubbly personality on the outside, but I’ve never been actually happy about my current life. I feel so stressed and i kept crying constantly because of academic pressure and my teacher’s expectation. It has gotten to the point where I can’t take care of myself and I even took a day off from school because of that recently. (Happened about 2 weeks ago) I’ve picked myself up but ever since that incident I will cry for no reason and have a mental breakdown over really small things. My motivation has been decreasing rapidly and I’ll constantly isolate myself from interacting with anyone. I just got scolded by my mom and I’m now all by myself, crying alone. My concentration has also become worse the older I got, I used to be able to read a book in one sitting, now I can’t even finish a single page of homework. I’ve been struggling so hard to get my work done but I can’t. I had to stay up really late every night (2am - 4am) only to get my work done. But I have to wake up 7am in the morning everyday for school. It’s honestly torturing and I literally wanna die. Aside from mental health issues, it causes my body to react negatively, I stopped having my period whenever school starts and I will gain fat really rapidly. The more fat I gain, the more insecure I get, I don’t even wanna go out because of my fat body. I tried to tell my friends, they are really supportive, but whenever my depressive feelings strike, I just don’t have the motivation to speak to them, I wanna keep them out from my negative feelings, the same goes to my family. School and academic stress has fucked me up entirely but I cannot stop it. I cannot quit school or I will lose my seemingly “bright” future, but I don’t know how long I can do this anymore. TLDR school gave me too much pressure for being the top student, fucked up my mental and physical health. I cannot do this anymore.",1,well_being_reddit_body

There are days where I have a text typed out to my boss and i just sit there and stare at for a minute before i delete it and go back in to drone mode. I don't dislike the people.

Unless I'm lucky I have to give 40 some odd years of my life to our labor force. Then, I'll be lucky if I get 10 years to enjoy when I'm old, frail and probably riddled with medical issues.

When I turned 18 alcohol helped a lot in reducing the anxiety but in turn I used to get very drunk to try to not feel anxious. I didn’t really mind at the time, it seemed like a good trade. I figured my anxiety would get reduced by getting older and getting more self-esteem. I got older but my self-esteem and anxiety only got worse. I started prioritizing online friendships over real ones as I felt less crippled by anxiety and could be more true to myself and not keep up the facade that I had built irl. I had a lot of fun online with some great people but eventually we stopped playing together as much and talking less and just split up. During this time I got more and more depressed without even realizing it at first. Eventually I didn’t talk to anyone irl and the few ones I had online I felt I couldn’t talk or play with. I felt nothing was fun anymore. And very slowly I started realizing that I was becoming depressed. A year of depression go brrr and I’m here. I feel I’ve learned a lot about myself this last year. How, why and when. I’ve never had meaning to my life but I’ve never needed it because I kept myself busy doing things I enjoyed.

Not everything, but a lot. Because ""I can go to them with anything"" right? Well I told them I was stressed out about school and that I don't think stressing out over tests is worth it right now. I said that school should come second, mental health first. They freaked out about this. Basically told me I'm lazy and need to focus on school cause ""that's my job."" They made me feel like it was ""wrong"" to ever say or think such a thing. I told them that I was stressed out about my future and feel like I need to do more towards my career. They basically said that's not important right now, worry about it later or ""on the side."" I even said that I'm suicidal.

503,"Many of us struggle with various types of addictions - internet, cigarettes, alcohol, gambling etc. Addiction puts lots of pressure on our own self and our loved ones. How many of us have thought about the origin of our addictions and the reasons why it's so hard to get rid of these habits? One of the biggest question remains is whether we are substituting our empty lives with these habits that are no longer serving our higher goals. There are several research studies that directs us to the fact that past Trauma could be the reason for addiction. As a Coach, I have worked closely with people with addiction issues and so far my realization is that many of them had gone through some form of abuse & trauma in the past. Abuse can come in different forms physical, mental, sexual, psychological and emotional. It is quite important to identify our past trauma and get some help rather than sweeping our problems under the carpet and living in denial. As humans we all need self care and community support to stay healthy and happy.

I’ve also been trying breathing exercises and doing stretching in the evenings when I get home from work. It seems to help a little.

It still does to this day. I miss just being in his arms and miss every little thing about him. You have no idea. And when he passed, my aunt and uncle were actually taking some time apart from each other because of marital issues. They still came to the funeral and even stayed with me in my apartment for a week after. They've always been loving and affectionate and all that even though they were on the other side of the country. At the time, they did offer me the chance to come live with them but I declined because I still had to finish college. He never got to the chance to see me in my cap and gown... Anyway, after I made my posts, I quickly called my aunt first and asked her if I could come stay with them. Eventually my uncle came in and we talked for about a half hour until my uncle asked, in a genuinely curious tone, ""Why do you want to come now though?"". And I just told them the truth I'm scared. I don't like being alone like this and not even having a friend nearby for support. It's just me. But thankfully they reassured me and said they'd love for me to come, even offering to pay for a plane ticket. I cried myself hysterical after they hung up.

I lived with my mum until I was 13 and suffered neglect and slight emotional abuse while living with her which obviously was the trigger for the anxiety and the depression. I’m mostly good now, I’m on medication and I’ve been seeing a counsellor at uni for most of my degree but sometimes I think about my childhood and get a bit of an ‘oof’ feeling over smaller things. Which is what’s brought me here, because of neglect from my mother I have bad oral hygiene. Growing up she never really encouraged me to be clean and stuff, so I was never told that I had to brush my teeth in the morning and evening, because of this brushing my teeth isn’t something I remember to do, and the importance of good dental hygiene was never something I was taught. And as simple a thing as it sounds, it’s one of the main things that stuck with me as a kind of memory from growing up in a neglectful environment. I really struggle with remembering to brush my teeth, and I don’t feel like asking my friends or flatmates to remind me to brush my teeth is really an option.

580,"My mom died yesterday night at around 12 am. She killed herself. I can only assume she has schizophrenia. The previous 2 weeks of her death, she was acting totally different, nothing of herself. She was going on about God (she was never religious) and how if we don’t believe in him we are going to hell. It all began from when she was dating this guy Joseph, and when she came home that night she was totally different. I now live with just my dad and sister, and all to remind I am just 16. It really hurts she is dead. All I can think about it her death. I cry off and on and some moments I feel fine then others times I feel numb. My family is being supportive- but none of them understand this pain. They remind me “it wasn’t her” I know it wasn’t her. My mom would have never done this to us. It doesn’t change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself. I can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom. It hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff. I mourn with happy pictures of her- still painful to think she would change so fast. I looked through notebooks of hers, she used to write like it was her life. She wrote lists and lists of things to do, chore lists, grocery lists, activity lists…etc. it was never ending. My mom was always full of life, always ready to take on what life gave her. She never considered suicide. The night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night. It hurt to hear her talk like that. She had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared. That morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket- apparently walking around the city.

585,Hello. Just wanted to make a post because today was a pretty sad day for me. I woke up this morning and went to the bathroom as its usually the first thing I do every morning and when I walked out I overhead my dad talking to my sister about not ending up like me. Obviously this hurt and usually I don't cry much but this morning I cried like a bitch. Hearing my dad say that to my sister really fucking hurts. Ugh. He says that he loves me but sometimes I don't know how true that is. I just wish that I didn't exist. I've been depressed for years and nothing has changed. I have lost nearly all my friends because I'm a complete loser who is addicted to smoking pot because its the only thing that can temporarily cover up the sadness. I'm starting college soon and my parents don't have any faith in me and honestly I don't have any faith in myself. I could barely pass high school because I have 0 motivation. How in the world would I be able to pass through college. I don't know how much longer I can take this shit... I've seen a therapist but she just told me and my parents that my internet use was the problem. Like really??? She was completely useless and I haven't seen one since. I live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood and I have everything I could want. A gaming PC. A high end smartphone. A puppy. And life still is just as mundane as usual. The only thing I have to look forward too anymore is smoking a bowl at night. Fuck. I'm starting to get suicidal thoughts and this is becoming really scary. I don't really know why I'm making this post I just wanted to get it all out I guess. I'm just tired of being a lonely loser who has 0 skills I guess.,1,well_being_reddit_body

This made me feel embarrassed because I don't know how to take compliments. But since then I've gotten more into it, and made noticable gains especially to my arms and legs. Cut to last night, starting a new job at a warehouse. One person who I never met said in a group conversation that he wants to get big like me.

621,"guys i fell in love. head over heels jumping off the diving board in love! and i think our story is pretty cool ) i (17f) started sixth form at a new school in september 2020. i have a friend (17m), let’s call him timmy, who goes to that school. for the sake of the story we’re going to call my boyfriend adam (17m). before i started at this new school, timmy warned me against this boy. he told me “there’s a boy called adam, he WILL try and get with you, don’t do it”. i’d heard of adam before as him and timmy were really close friends so it shocked me when timmy ‘warned’ me against him. he elaborated, telling me that adam had talked to many girls in the past and it had always ended badly. he told me that his relationships never last very long, and the girls he usually gets with are timmys friends, and so it ends awkwardly. so it comes to september, and i finally meet adam. he’s an absolute god. confident,attractive,funny and we quickly exchanged snapchat’s. only, i’d totally forgotten about what timmy told me. i only remembered when multiple girls who disliked adam had noticed we were flirting and told me not to be with him. i heard story upon story (some of which weren’t true) about adams past and it was as if everyone was against us ever being a thing. meanwhile, i was coming to like him more and more. on november 16 after 2 months of overnight facetime calls and afterschool mcdonald’s dates , he asked me to be his girlfriend and i said yes with no hesitation. it’s been nine months and i can honestly say that i’m so glad i didn’t let anyone come between us. everyday he makes me feel like a princess and i just feel like my life is pieces together with him in it. i know what you’re thinking. young love never lasts. but i don’t want a future without this boy. nothing makes sense without him, and i hope everyone can find this love at some point in their lives. thanks for reading )",0,well_being_reddit_body

And I would remove the sprouts only for the sprouts to come back again two days later. I looked online and apparently if you put apples in the same place as potatoes, it helps keep them from sprouting. Onions actually have the opposite effect and makes potatoes sprout faster.

I am fucking up so badly though in these classes. Just procrastinating work and unlike previous grades they don't chase you down if you don't have it. My parents are pretty strict.

Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist? ​ An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute.

663,"16 F) i’ve never knew how stressed out i was with everything. two days ago i had a mental breakdown at work. i remember hanging clothes on the sales floor and having suicidal thoughts. i remember not being able to breathe, so i quickly ran to the restroom and broke down in tears. i started banging on the sink out of frustration and anger. I haven’t been diagnosed yet, but if the doctor told me i had depression, anxiety, and bipolar depression. i don’t think i would be surprised. my manager came in the restroom and asked me what was wrong but i couldn’t get it out. this is my a millionth time crying at work. just last week i congratulated myself for not calling out sick when i was really just depressed. i told her she should leave and not to worry about what’s wrong with me because i’m use to constantly crying. i then leave the restroom and ran to my car without clocking out. my crying became even louder and i started banging on the steering wheel while screaming. i just don’t know what to do anymore. ever since that day i’ve been thinking about going to do things such as getting my nose pierced, but lord knows how my african parents would take that.(at a point when i don’t even care anymore and do what makes me happy. they already weren’t happy when i first got my hair locked up.) when i came home later that day my mom asked me why was i crying at work. of course i couldn’t tell her because african parents never take this type of shit serious, so i shrugged it off. (my school called my mom back in january about my suicide attempt, and she was pissed off about it. she told me not to tell them that next time.) it’s been so many fucked up shit to happen to me within just one time frame this year, but i mean everyone had a bad year this year.",1,well_being_reddit_body

Throughout high school and college, school stressed me out like crazy. I would spend 10's of hours studying for tests instead of just 2-3 like my friends. It would always take me a really long time because a lot of times while studying I would get stressed and not be able to think clearly. My friends would praise me for being able to spend so much time studying and ""being focused"". In reality I was going crazy on the inside. My methods worked, got into an awesome university after high school and also have an amazing job right now. But despite all that I still struggle with believing in myself. I'm convinced I'm stupid and wont be able to solve problems on my own. This past month I really struggled to finish a project. It caused me SO much stress. I lost my appetite, and lost lots of weight because I was always feeling stressed/bad/sad that I wasn't able to finish the project at the pace I wanted and I wasn't able to solve bugs quickly. I know a lot of times the answer is right in front of me when working on code, but just like when I was studying, my mind gets clouded with stress and I can't think or do anything properly.

Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work. I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change. The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me. Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay. I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me. I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it.

Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me.

It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life?

I want to be able to compose and improvise but I guess no one can teach me. I guess it's because i lack creavtivity and I'm not good at applying things . I've always had trouble writing things in school because it turns out dull and unimaginative and I'm just not good at it. I'm always stuck at the basics. And my learning sucks because before I even internalize it I've already read or go through the the material hundreds of times so I know the material if I see it but i cannot apply it.

771,"For me, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression during this holiday season is about eliminating negative/toxic influences and replacing them with positive and healthy ones. It also helps by staying present within awareness and being grateful for all that I have... without comparing what I had or what I did to celebrate the holidays last year - this is vital to ensuring my peace and joy through the season and beyond. For instance, I can't travel to be with my family this year so I will do a Zoom call... which is lame and depressing in comparison. So to help make it interesting I'll make the Zoom call more fun by playing games with my fam, (jackbox, quiplash, etc.) and putting the screen on my family room tv so I feel like they're with me instead of on my cell phone screen. It's not about which is better, being with them in person or on a webinar, but making the most of my circumstance and adapting... finding the light so to speak and residing within the positivity of that adaptation... and going one step further and being grateful for it! Many people will not even have the opportunity to have a zoom call with their family, I will. This is a BLESSING. Anywho, I just released a new video on YT sharing ten tips to help us all make the most of this holiday season.

Then there was a hurricane. We lost our home, so all of our stuff is in storage and we are living in a bedroom with family. Sales started good and now it’s dead. We have nothing. We have negative hundreds of dollars in our bank account because of auto-pay bills with $15 cash to our name and I won’t get paid again next week. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve looked for other jobs, but nothing matches my previous salary that we built our bills around. Our credit is bad and relatively new, so we can’t refinance cars right now or skip payments and we can’t get loans because my partner doesn’t make enough and I haven’t been at this job long enough. I don’t know what to do. I can’t get a second job because I work nearly 52 hours a week. My partner works full time and uses the downtime to do the laundry for me and run the other errands I can’t during the day. I’m just at an impass.

794,"Hi, just wanted to ask if stress can cause many many weird physical symptoms? All started when my taste and smell senses decreased a lot for a few weeks, took 3 covid tests and all negative. During the same time my right arm started to hurt, then my right leg and some time later my whole right side of body went numb (not like paralized numb but skin feels numb and tight). I also have buzzing in my arm and leg and my fingers feel stiff (a few days ago my little toe in right leg went numb too - like really can’t move it). And my jaw hurts a lot on the right side - that jaw thing has been going of for the last year, dentists say nothing is wrong. I noticed that I clenched my teeth sometimes so thought that maybe I am just so stressed and this is the outcome. But right now I don’t clench my teeth but my jaw pain is still back (with all these new symptoms). Anyway I have been to my doctor and neurologist and right now I am waiting for MRIs (neuro wants to eliminate MS). When this all first started I didn’t feel more stressed or anything but now of course I am stressed. I feel kinda fine some days and then the other days (like today) my arm and leg are in so much pain (I think nerve pain, my skin feels very sensitive and almost painful to touch too) and I just feel so weak and tired and only want to stay in bed and feel like I want to cry. So I guess my question is that could all these symptoms be because of stress or anxiety? My neuro seems nice but all the other doctors seemed to think and said that “maybe you are just stressed”. Of course I don’t want to get diagnose like MS from my neuro but at the same time I really would not want to believe that just stress could cause these kind of symptoms.

Inability to concentrate. The symptoms may persist for some time after stopping the day's work, although rarely for long. They get worse throughout the week, and seem to be the mildest on Mondays. They are also mildest in the morning, worsening throughout the day. The symptoms are worsened while performing difficult tasks, or tasks that have no clear way towards a solution.

I know I’m not the only one struggling at the minute. But I feel like I’m doing so shit compared to everyone else. With absences cause of covid and everyone ordering for Christmas it’s been a nightmare often working 50 hour weeks from a usual 28. It’s not even only that but I am pretty sensitive type and I feel like I’m fucking up more than anybody else. When I feel useless at something I just want to give up. It’s only my girlfriend pushing me through at the moment. I know it’s childish to just want to quit when things go wrong but I feel on edge atm.

So i joined the gun group and the exercises and drills were easy to learn but hard to do. I messaged my IC and he said i could leave and he doesn’t blame us because of the injuries he had also faced.

By the year 2000 I was finishing High School I was going on 6 years of depression at that point and I already had a overdose suicide attempt a year prior. Now I'm 40 years old and it has been 26 years of depression I never accomplished anything in my life never even had a gf a complete absolute loser and now on top of that I have permanent neurological health problems that makes my life even worst it's not from my suicide attempt but something not related. I guess my point is depression made me lazy and a miserable bastard that never connected with the outside world it stoled my youth away something I can never have back. Living with regrets is just as bad as depression don't be me there is no recovering from lost time and permanent health issues plus clinical depression it's a living hell.

What do I mean by that? Let's say I'm laying in my bed relaxing and my relative opens a door of another room, I immediately fall into this ""shock mode for a second"", my all attention is on that sound and I become sooo aware of that, there's no more relaxation. Another thing- I could be relaxing and random noise from... Idk, anywhere happen and then I'm all awake, disturbed, tense. So I basically want to ask you- these forms of stress, are they normal? Or is it a sign of something going on? Because I never paid attention to that but as I got more aware of myself because of different practices and teachings, I've started noticing that when I meditate, let's say, a random noise outside can disrupt that more relaxed state and bring me to full awareness/stress mode even when I'm in a safe environment (my home).

850,"Today is the anniversary of my daughter's death. She died in my arms, and I am grateful I could be with her. She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth. She had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se. In the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me. During my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time. I demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together. When she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life. My daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral. I have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year.

My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression. I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing. at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this.",1,well_being_reddit_body
864,"Our happiness depends on many things. Your state changes depending on how you react to changes in your career, marriage, personal life and finances. There are several chemicals which makes you feel happy and these chemicals are Dopamine and serotonin. Your body releases dopamine as part of the reward system and Serotonin is more free-flowing when you feel important or valued by those around you. When you’re experiencing serotonin happiness, it takes no effort to feel joyful. No one feels happy 100% of the time, but the science of what causes happiness shows us that there are things we can do to boost our mood like exercising, eating your favorite meal, doing things you love, etc. [ Watch this video to know more",0,well_being_reddit_body

I graduated high school in 2012 and since then i have isolated myself rarely leaving my house. I'm posting this hoping someone will listen and maybe give advice. I was raised by my grandparents and growing up they were controlling and overprotective. I did not get to do things most other kids were doing. I just stayed home all the time and played video games or watched tv. When i was in school i had no friends and rarely talked. I was not bullied but most of my classmates would not talk to me. My teachers said i had a learning disability so thought out school i had extra help with my classes.. My grandfather died in 2007, After high school i isolated myself. I have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers. The time has passed by so fast and i cant believe i let this happened. I Feel like there is no hope for things to change. Who would hire someone like me. I made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college. I also would like a girlfriend but I'm short and too shy. I'm very depressed and thinking about ending my life. Edit. I never thought my post would get this much attention.

My bf at that time (now ex) would always point out that I've gained weight, everytime we'd meet. Also people in my surroundings, even my family kept saying ""maybe you should consider losing weight. You can see how much that affected my self esteem... I think I wasn't that much overweight, I weighted around 85 kg (187 lbs) - june last year. I'm not sure how I've started my journey. But I guess meeting the right people pushed me in the right direction. One day, I woke up, installed couple of apps, decided to try them. They were a bit hard and kinda boring but I wasn't going to give up. I stumbled across a channel which I feel in love with it instantly. The channel's videos showed a handful of workouts that anyone can follow, and most importantly I'm having fun while losing weight. So I kept going, day after day, month after month. And here I am today, super happy, because I actually managed to lose 20 kg (44 lbs) in just one year. That was my goal, which I'm super close to achieve it. I could not believe my eyes when I weighted myself this evening. 65,5 kg (144 lbs) is there in front of my eyes. All that hard work did pay off in the end. There were many setbacks, I fell down multiple time. But here I am, happy, and I'm in love with my body more than ever. I would like to thank the people who loved my body from the very start to this day now. That kind of encouragement is what I needed to keep going.

934,"So I'm going into the 10th grade this year (which for some of you is year 11), but I'm very worried about how I'll be able to keep on top of school. Last school year I barely did anything at all -- I couldn't. The beginning of my academic downfall was when I was taken into a residential programme to deal with a series of mental problems. During and when I got out I felt too morbidly depressed to do pretty much anything, especially school work. I would never shower, never brush me teeth, never flush the toilet, never clean my bedroom, (you know the routine). My school is very demanding, but I was lucky that the faculty was aware that I wasn't able to be as ahead as my peers which helped because it felt as if everything was far too overwhelming to do and I physically could not without my head hurting or something of the sort. Now that summer is over and school is starting again, I have no idea how I'm going to manage keeping on top of my work. I do really want to try my best this year but I can barely complete or start my first few assignments without getting insanely overwhelmed. This year I won't get the same leniency as I did last year, and honestly I can't say I want it either because it too came with its downsides. Other kids would get angry at me because I was exempt from doing some assignments, and also it made me feel as if I'd failed at being a human along with everything else. I could barely keep on top of my hygiene, I wouldn't eat, I could barely get out of bed or look the slightest bit decent when leaving the house. It was as if I was a baby that had to be carried around due to it's helplessness, I hated it. albeit It was far better than drowning in my own academic failure and being personally held accountable for my lack of effort towards my education.

945,"I'm a guy in the mid 30's, had only a single relationship and intimacy partner so far and I'm almost literally dying to be close to a girl. But through that relationship, I learned a lot about myself, which did not improved my already broken self image. One thing is, that I can't have a serious relationship with a girl I barely feel attracted to. Might sound like a no-brainer, but I mean by character and looks. Character alone will just end badly because of the second problem there always **will** be a more attractive girl. Again, maybe a no-brainer even if alone for statistical reasons, but it's still a problem with/for me. No matter how attractive ""my"" girl would be, eventually there'd be a more attractive one, 'stealing' at least part of my attention, intentionally or not. But what I mean with this so far is just how I would end up feeling, as far as attractiveness by looks go. Just because there is another girl which looks more attractive than ""mine"", doesn't mean I'd dare to drop or intentionally neglect her. But I am also not that dense to think that everything's going to be fine, if I end up fantasizing about another girl. That just hurts, no matter if it's by being found out or just open about it, having your SO correctly guess it, or incorrectly assume it. It's painful at least if not outright insulting, regardless of being in control about those feelings or not. So when I end up day dreaming again, about having a cute girlfriend, the spiral to hell goes down fast Starting with my self-hate for being a hypocrite by wishing for a ""cute"" girlfriend while I'm at best just average looking. Then it steps up to how I deserve not even an equally ""average"" looking one, for the reasons above.

When I have things that I want to do outside of work I get stressed trying to do them because of my girlfriend. I fear that she will turn angry about what I’m doing, so I hurry doing laundry, cleaning, cooking, playing games etc. She sometimes demands my full attention, because I do become quite unavailable doing my “tasks”.

I can see how this would be a great piece of advice, if it actually worked for me.

I've tried the gym, running, tennis, football, photography, hell even playing video games I get bored of eventually. Maybe it's because of my depression, but I really struggle to find something I actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time. Most things that I find which I genuinely enjoy, my enjoyment/determination fizzles out after a few weeks to the point where my effort put in outweighs my enjoyment so I just stop.

967,"Background; My actual car is a manual and it got reversed into the other day so driving an automatic hire car) Last night I was driving with my girlfriend back to her house and I felt a bit sick in the stomach and was just sitting in silence, I was in my own world stressing about my car and life in general - I was driving at about 80-90km/h and for the first time ever I mistakenly thought I was still in my own car and as something went into my eye I went to downshift so I could keep a bit of control and speed whilst I fix my eye and I hit the break with my left foot. In the 1 second it took to process everything and think about everything that was going on and as I was going to take my foot off the break the car that was behind me smashed into us and caused a 4 car accident. Yes, it was a very honest mistake, it was the first time it’s ever happened and I thank God no one was seriously hurt. The car behind me seemed too close but I just can’t help being depressed about the whole situation; if I would’ve stopped at a service station earlier or been in a different lane would it still have happened? Am I the one at fault because I made that small mistake? Why did it have to happen when my girlfriend was in the car with me? Just why? I feel like everyone has the right to push me down and say I’m in the wrong and I feel everyone should criticise me and make me feel like the piece of trash I am. People keep saying accidents happen and sometimes God puts us through things we don’t understand and that they’ve done the same thing too when driving an automatic but I can’t help but feel like they’re just taking pity on me and don’t want me to feel bad when I should.

Brief background, I have struggled with quite significant anxiety, and resultant relatively minor depression over the last decade or so. I am on medication now after having been signed off work for a month a short while ago. Recently I have felt very resilient, and enjoying the challenges of work for the first time again in years. I have had the strength, and inclination to put myself out there a bit more at work, and to have my voice heard on issues and disagreements where I genuinely feel like I know better or have something to add. This has then led to disagreements that make me feel uncomfortable and anxious again. They are probably minor things to normal people, but I can’t help but let them get to me. And once I start to fight for something I struggle to let it go which makes things worse, and then I feel worse. My instinctive takeaway from these experiences are that I should not speak up, and I need to just be passive and let others dictate as that seems to be the only way I can handle it and not cause the situations that cause my anxiety.

My family was very anti homosexuality so I ended up doing the same. I moved out and went to my states University where I met the first person to logically call me out on my shit. I said, “no homo” because that was a thing at the time, and he justifiably called me out. Became good friends and even lived together for a year. I ended up dropping out of school to work, moved out and lost touch with him. In the 10 years since I’ve met the best friends in my life who are an interracial married gay couple. Growing up a straight white male in the environment I did, this was not something I thought would happen. I am ashamed to admit but in middle school I argued all gay people should be sent to an island separate from the world. I blame the sheltered town I lived in but mostly myself for accepting that reality where nobody told me it was an incredibly hateful, insensitive idea. Tonight I went to dinner with my best friends and saw my first openly gay friend at a table across the room. I didn’t want to intrude on his groups dinner and I’m a coward so I simply asked the waiter to anonymously pay for his tables meal.

I'm working shifts that are past midnight and between 6.5 and 8 hours for 5 days in a row. That would be fine if I didnt have school and could drive. But they're really up to the limit.

It started when my wife had a miscarriage. Abdominal pain, lots of gas... thought it was my appendix. Doctor said it was stress related. Then it was glandular fever which caused me to lose weight, lose my appetite, became completely fatigued. More abdominal pain, headaches. Again, was told it was stress related. Thought it was bowel cancer or pancreatitis. Then it was muscle pain which I thought was male breast cancer or lymphoma. Last year, back pain, neck ache, abdominal cramps... had an XRay, blood tests, ultrasounds... all fine! About a month or two ago, I realised that I had tremors in my hands. Just slight usually when gripping. Also had slight weakness in my knees, pains all over my body in my muscles, twitches. My brain went to MS I keep getting told it’s stress. Another blood test last week, all fine! I’m being sent to a neurologist and I’m having another ultrasound to check for a hernia. But the doctor thinks it’s stress. Here’s the thing. Everything stresses me out. My son wakes me up through the night (he’s 2), my wife is messy, my commute is long, my work is in London and stresses me out, selfish people in cars or on the street, lack of consideration from people, shoddy workmanship, no time to exercise... every, single, thing gets to me. Unless I’m running through the countryside, or sitting watching TV, or having a drink with friends. I am so so worried that I’m dying all the time that other little stresses just add to it.

1040,"I have had depression throughout my adult life. I had a baby about 1 week ago and was preemptively diagnosed with PPD during my pregnancy given my mental health history and a fairly rough go of it during pregnancy. I am not sure what to do. I've tried various SSRI/SNRI's but the main side effect for me is excessive drowsiness, obviously not doable right now with a newborn and very little sleep. I'm in therapy, but I've been bouncing around different therapists for the last 6 years and no one has really helped me at all. I think I am in the small subset of people for whom therapy just isn't a good treatment option. Exercise has been the most helpful for me in the past in managing depression but I absolutely cannot go for a walk for exercise. Walking is not intense enough and I end up ruminating and feel worse than ever the more I walk. The last few weeks of pregnancy my mental health was in the garbage after I was going on lots of walks to try to get labor going. I'm really not sure what I can do to get moving after the c-section. I don't even think I could do yoga as it requires too much core work. Walking is just not an option for me with the rumination and intrusive thoughts. Does anyone have any suggestions of what to do?",1,well_being_reddit_body

1042,Hello dear people. So my girlfriend was diagnosed with depression about a year ago and she had a burnout because of her work. She has been on meds and seeing a therapist about a year now. For the past two weeks she said that she feels nothing about everything (numb) and wants to be alone. She doesn't answer calls from anyone and little chores feel like hell for her. I have been trying to help by cleaning etc... Now she said that she wants me to go away but still loves me very much. What should I do? Should I respect her wishes and go to live with my dad for some time or just be here for her? Should I wait her to contact me and tell her that I am here for her if she needs anything or what? It hurts so much seeing someone you love like this.,1,well_being_reddit_body

So I did the number 1 no no and googled it, well according to google I might have advance cancer and dying in less then a year. That caused me to stress out and think what if I am not around for my kids to see my kids grow up. So I called the doctor and I have an appointment with him on Tuesday but he sent me to get a blood test in advance which all came up perfect except for cholesterol levels. So after the blood test results I think my anxiety lowered but every often I still feel the chin tingling. So back to the question can you be stress or anxious on something without realizing. Thanks for the advice Just an update my doctor doesn’t think my chin is anything even though I still feel the tingling feeling even now. He said give it another month and then we will go for an mri. Is it possible that stress of me worrying has been causing this symptom and if so it cannot be healthy having stress symptoms for like a month Thanks for the advice",1,well_being_reddit_body

I can be quite vocal about how I'm feeling as sometimes I feel like it's better to be brutally honest about how you're feeling rather than to not say anything. But the other half of the time when I'm having a mental health crisis tbh it kind of scares me in a way because what happens is that I bottle all my struggles and emotions up then I'll have a breakdown or a fit of emotional burnout/anger but most of the time this happens when I'm in my bedroom with the door shut so obviously no one else is going to know that I've had a breakdown because it's happened behind closed doors. I wouldn't say I'm naturally an irritable or easily angered person, but when someone bottles up their emotions, everyone will explode with a different emotion, for me it's usually sadness and anger. Anger for having a breakdown because it makes me feel weak and sad because it feels like this is a vicious cycle because I bottle my emotions up, then I get more and more tetchy, then I explode, then I feel like I've fucked up because I clearly can't control my emotions very well, then I feel guilty that other people can control their emotions better than I can",1,well_being_reddit_body

My mind telling me noone cares about me or wanting someone to reach out to see if I was ok. Sadly it doesn't work the way you think.

I was suicidal for weeks wanting to end my life until I realized that I don't need self validation or love from other people.

1095,I (28f) absolutely hate dating but i want love. I’m constantly stressing myself out whenever i become interested in a new guy. I stress because im constantly asking myself if im not good enough for him... especially when he doesn’t respond for hours. I stress when he says he wants to go out but flakes last minute. I stress when I’m with him and i can’t read if he’s interested. Then i stress when i think he’s just being nice when i ask him something and he gives a good answer. Of course i ALWAYS play it cool. Like laughing it off when he flakes. Or saying no worries when he cancels. Or giving him space when i don’t want to look too clingy. But inside I’m going crazy! I want to turn this worrying off.

I don't want people to occupy me or make me happy. I just want to be how I am. Angry, sad, tired. And just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how I feel and why I feel that way. I don't even want help. Because everytime someone tries to help, it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that I don't want. It's not that I see my depression as a disease or illness, I see it as a symptom for something deeper. For the fact that I simply don't want to be part of this society, be ""normal"", hang around with others. Meeting friends feels so pointless, so shallow. Like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments. I don't want to forget, because I actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something.

I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.

I have been out of work throughout the pandemic and while it carried its own type of stressors I noticed after awhile that I had little to no heat burn, rarely experienced migraines anymore, and even my asthma seemed to subside. I have surmised that they were all in someway triggered by stress/anxiety. Of course I have been searching for a new job but out of fear from the pandemic I wasn’t in desperation mode. Now over a year out it just seems like time and I’ve been more heartily searching. I have multiple interviews coming up and while I haven’t consciously stressed over it, but I have noticed that I have been experiencing indigestion and last night I had the worst migraine of my life. Pandemic aside, I have enjoyed my free time over this last year and after last night I’m afraid to go back to that level of stress. Anyone have any suggestions? Should I talk to my doctor?

1198,"Hi reddit, i'm in need of some advice. 2 Years ago i worked myself into a burn-out of which I am still recovering. I worked in an online marketing team that had a lot of desk/computer hours. I still don't have a lot of energy and i still feel stressed, emotionally drained from time to time and still have a hard time living a normal life. However, my biggest problem is that I cannot do computer work anymore. Whether it's gaming, watching video's, school work or just browsing for fun, i cannot last longer than 45 Minutes without having one or more of these following symptoms - Lightheadedness - Heavy head - Pshyical Stress, my body feels pumped up like it want's to run a marathon - Concentration Issues I do not seem to have these symptoms when staring at my Phone Screen or TV screen. I've always spent a lot of time behind my computer (Gaming, Chatting with friends etc) but now i cannot even have 1/8th the screen time that I could endure. It kinda feels like my brain associates just sitting behind a computer with enourmous amounts of stress. My question is, is there a way I can train my body or mind that I do not feel stressed anymore when sitting behind a computer? I know that I'm not fully recovered yet and that I cannot expect big results but It's a big part of my life that I don't want to lose. I already correct my shoulders when they are tense, I take regular breaks and I don't do work that stresses me out.

1234,"Dear kind souls of Reddit, I am furious and under a huge amount of stress right now , but I am going to be okay. I would appreciate some words of wisdom and good vibes going my way. I bought a mobile home on its own lot in 2016. I got the home inspected prior to purchasing it and I got house insurance and title insurance. After I moved in, I began to have problems with the water line freezing and breaking every winter. I have spent around $4,000 in repairs over the past two years and I think I have finally solved the problem. My sewer stopped working properly in March of this year and I have had to dismantle most of the sewer underneath the house to solve the problem. The plumber and I put a camera down and we found an unknown blockage somewhere close to the street. I ended up having to dig up my driveway, break the sewer and put the camera through....only to find that the sewer is clean. The sewer cleaner said that it was probably frozen and he has been to my house to thaw the sewer when the previous owners owned it. In order to fix the broken pipe, the plumber is going to have to dig down underneath the mobile home to connect to the iron sewer that is under there, and in order to do this, I will have to completely remove my house, fix the sewer, and then put my house back on my property. The total bill for this will be around $10,000 and it is at the point where I am ready to just get a new house. I will be living paycheck to paycheck in a new house, but I don’t really have many options. I would not have bought this house if I had known all of the problems that came with it and insurance won’t cover any of this.

1270,"Hi, I'm dealing with a hard-to-grasp psychological problem. The pattern is somewhat like this I'm always highly stimulated. Sometimes I'm tempted to work too hard, and end up in some sort of mini-burnout. This happens about once a week, and leaves me foggy and unmotivated (dopamine-depleted?) for about 2 days. I have a lot of atypical adaptations built in that are related to this. When I'm overly excited, it inhibits me (probably the same way that anxious people are inhibited), but I don't feel any anxiety. I'm often hardly aware of how stimulated I am. Sometimes, I am somehow compelled to go into super sayan mode, work my ass off, try to complete my whole to-do list in one day.This pretty much instantly triggers a mini-burnout. This also happens when I drink just one cup of coffee. Except when I'm socially active then I can take all the stimulants I want and be fine. Weird. This state has gone on for about 2 years, and I still haven't been able to make sense of it. Maybe there's a blindspot somewhere. Anyway, other than perhaps someone being able to label this thing for me, I have a question about a specific solution I have in mind. My defense mechanism for high stress is usually to tone it down, through reframing my situation as easy, meditating, ignoring my to-do list, etc. Now I have a suspicion that this mini-burnout is emotional or motivational in nature. That I'm not actually chemically depleted, but that there's a ton of emotional baggage that needs to be cleared each time that I go down. Or alternatively that I'm just fed up with how little progress I'm making given the effort I put in. If this is true, it requires a whole different approach. It would involve not changing the arousal but the valence of my emotions. Reframing my high stress as excitement, instead of anxiety. Maybe that will make the stress less chronic. But I'm afraid that this will just put me further in the wrong place, because it will involve kicking down habits that reduce arousal, thereby increasing it. And that would be extremely high-cost, for I've been in a very very bad place as a result of burnout. Could anyone shine their light on this? Any progress on this problem would be major for me.

I was suppose to leave my country for uni since its abroad but it's been online for now. Just a background I've dealt with anxiety and depression for some years now and even used to take medication for it. I'm off of it now. Uni sucked for me even in semster 1 but somehow I got through. This time everything just feels so much harder and like I'm definitely failing most of my courses. I've never has a good relationship with academics. A lot of my problems stem from that. And honestly at this point I'm searching Google 'how to study' because I have no idea. I'm not too sure if I absolutely hate my degree. Its bachelor of economics. It's just even if I dont like that it's not like I have something else in mind that I would want to study. I already failed a course in sem 1 and taking it again in sem 2. And now I feel I'll fail like 4 of my courses for sure. Half of the stuff I dont get and I dont know how do I study especially when all I feel is so much street and anxiety and pressure. The more I think about it the more I get panic attacks. And just not doing uni is not an option for me. Like I've definitely thought of it but know its something I cant do. So now I'm here just asking for help. I dont know what to do. I cant seem to study and even if I do I cant seem to get things. Being online I feel such a discontent from professor and my peers alike. Like I genuinely have no uni friends. I cant fail because I dont have time to do those failed courses again. Most of my assignments up till now have either been bad grades or just not submitted. I dont know how I'm suppose to do the rest of the term. Honestly feel like just not doing life.,1,well_being_reddit_body

1294,"Spending time in nature makes a huge difference to our mental health; research has shown it can decrease our stress levels, reduce our heart rate and reduce our blood pressure - but one of the most interesting effects it has is to reduce how much we ruminate, how much we attach ourselves to our thoughts. When we get swept away by our thoughts and lose touch with the present moment, suffering isn’t far behind. Being lost in the past and future drives a great deal of our sadness and anxiety. Where nature is incredibly powerful is in its ability to focus our attention, taking us out of our heads and into our surroundings via our senses. And aside from all that, it takes us away from the information bombardment for a little while, away from our work and our phone and the TV. So when we give our full attention to a bird that's landed on a tree or take the time to look at the different parts of a flower we’re giving a minds a break and bringing ourselves back to the only place we can be happy - here and now.

I have no energy lately. Everything's overwhelming me. I feel like I am constantly on the edge of breaking down in tears. My boyfriend is sick, that's why I have to do most of the housework. Because of his illness he'll go in rehab in a bit more than a week. Idk I am just, overwhelmed by life I guess. And I wish there was someone who could just take away half of the excersises I have to do. I want to stop the time for a month, for rehabilitation. And then for another so I can catch up with all these excersises. Thank you for reading so far, I really appreciate that. I hope I didn't bore you. Please be nice if you decide to comment. Thank you",1,well_being_reddit_body

1338,So to put a long story short my mother’s parents both died when she was 16 and had to raise herself my father is in prison for attempted murder and she used to be a VP For coke and lost her job due to lay offs. Has not had very good success with jobs ever since. She’s mid 50s and has a lot of physical problems and has attachment issues with animals where it’s to the point where she can’t even take care of them properly I moved back in with my girlfriend to help her out with bills and such whilst she was unemployed due to covid. She now has a new job and her car needs a whole new transmission and can’t afford to have it replaced. When she has 1200 to go towards I offered to front 800 to cover the bill but she ended up spending it all in two days anyways. So she’s been driving in my brand new car to get to work until she can fix her car. On her days off all she does is lay on the couch and watch Netflix that I pay for while I care for her animals. It’s extremely emotionally exhausting seeing my mother like this and idk what to do to make it better. She’s paying for my younger sisters car insurance and I just found out she spent 800 dollars to get my sister a new car. I just don’t know what to do. This is more of a rant than advice but at this point I don’t know what to do.,1,well_being_reddit_body
1339,"Honestly, I don’t see how therapy could even help me at this point. I am currently starving myself because I hate my appearance, especially my chubby face. I assume I’m suffering from bdd..but it doesn’t matter because I don’t want to get treatment anyway. I don’t agree with the notion that I deserve a happy life.Not only that but I would have to once again..like with most things in my life, redefine my definition of happiness, which I refuse to. Just because there’s people like me who have managed to live a “meaningful” life doesn’t mean I should or could.If I were them I wouldn’t want to live either. Looking and living with my face..as well as imagining my life and future with it..makes me feel like death...like when someone you love dies..that grief. When you cry all the time because you can’t cope with the futility of the situation..there’s nothing you can do and this is your life now and forever. Crying and feeling the worst pain ever..being able to calm down for a while..distracting yourself, participating in life..whatever life looks like for you..only to remember and start crying again. Imagine the first few days or weeks after someones death..but feeling like that every day for months and years. Seeing myself makes me sick, I gag and lose my appetite, will to do anything, if I saw myself..I’d shoot myself in the face. Being at this stage, where I am cold all the time, in pain from not eating, having heart palpitations..feeling like I’m dying..makes me feel happy. People try to warn me, share their concerns..as if they’re not feeding into my disorder. As if death scares me. Honestly, I love seeing myself rot, slowly rotting away, feeling the flesh disappearing,knowing some day I won’t have to be conscious in this body anymore and all that’s going to be left of me is going to be bones. I don’t see how the argument that death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem is supposed to help? Define temporary? One whole life is temporary..",1,well_being_reddit_body

1341,"Hi I’m new here. I’ve battled with depression for maybe 15 years? Or more I don’t even know. The last year has been so much worse for me and it has nothing to do with Covid. I’m honestly sick of hearing about covid. My grandmother died a year ago and I feel like that’s when things made a turn for the worse. Her death was horrible. It wasn’t sudden but it wasn’t expected. Her health took a turn for the worse out of nowhere and she slowly died and I had to watch everyday for two months. It was traumatizing. My anxiety had become so unbearable I reached out to my asshole doctor for medication and got prescribed Prozac which I had used before and it helped. This time it helped but then I found it started making me incredibly angry and worse. So I went off and tried to just deal with it. Because there are good days where I do feel fine. But then it started happening again so I reached out to a psychotherapist. She helped me to acknowledge how shitty of a childhood I had so now more trauma has been brought up. I feel so overwhelmed with things in my life as well. Like working night shifts(which I should be getting off soon hopefully), a renovation to our only bathroom that started in April and still isn’t done.. body image issues like crazy. I have 1 friend but I try not to vent to her because I hate being so negative all the time. Friends are so hard to make for me. Anyway I have a lot going on. I made the call to my doctor again to try a different medication and cried to his receptionist. While my husband just stood there and didn’t comfort at all.

1352,"As the Earth rotates daily on its axis, every morning the sun brings light to the darkness, warmth and comfort to the chill of night, photo synthesis to plants, and security to humans. It's for this reason that as far back as 14,000 8.C.E., adoration of the sun has been sketched onto stone tablets and cave walls. Countless mythologies (including civilizations in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Mayans and the Aztecs, and the Australian Aborigines, to name just a few) have extolled the sun as worthy of worship, as well as a source of enlightenment, illumination, and wisdom. While the sun may be almost 93 million miles away, when it becomes active it has significant consequences to life on Earth because the Earth and the sun are related by electromagnetic fields. On a grand scale, it is impossible to deny the interconnectivity between the sun's energy, the Earth's energy, and the energy of all living species. On a micro level, all you have to do is look at the life cycle of a fruit or vegetable to understand this interdependence. Consciously absorbing that energy to combine with your own Spiritual Energy has tremendous benefits for your astral body, physical health and much more. Your spiritual energy goes under many different names like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more. Here's a 3 minute [YouTube video]( expanding more on the benefits and how to, actually absorb the energy from the sun, through your own self-induced voluntary goosebumps from positive events/thoughts/memories/feelings.",0,well_being_reddit_body

I am a mature adult, financially ok, grown children & grands, decent job, wonderful wife, nice house. The setting is wonderful. The plot since July needs a serious rewrite. One of my sibling had dementia and her child said multiple times to multiple official people that she wanted to kill her mother. I filed for guardianship, and it drug on until last month. My niece was successful - she starved my sister to death. Adult protective services, the judge, the lawyers, none of them took my niece seriously. I am devastated- I should have pressed the attorney more, been more assertive. My remaining siblings aren't talking to me. During this time frame of July - May, 3 of my dogs have died from unrelated causes- cancer, adverse reaction to heartworm treatment, and pool accident. My wife had a cancerous polyp in her colon removed, now she has a dubious image on her recent mammogram. I just found out today that my position at my job is not being renewed so I have a job until June, but unsure of what the future holds. Additionally, a grandchild was born at the end of 2020. My son and DIL know only what their doctor and the internet say. For the first two months, the baby didn't gain weight ,and didn't sleep, My DIL was breast feeding and took caffeine pills at the same time. The pediatrician never asked my DIL about caffeine, so it was never brought up. Additionally, the baby wasn't given enough milk/formula. After fretting and telling my son about the effects of caffeine and then about the amount of food, now my grandchild is fat and sassy, but my son tells me he doesn't want to waste the formula so only small bottles are made for each feeding. So here I am tonight, as every night, stressed, tense, can't sleep without prescription intervention, sex is a faint memory.

It feels strange to realise this...I remember the feeling of being relaxed after a nice calming bath or having a scented candle burning, but I really don’t recall a time that I wasn’t worried or tense about something?! Like there’s always something at the back of my mind or an issue I’m really worried about, I’m never truly content with my life! In the past year I’ve developed a few health issues, all of which have been traced back to being too stressed. More recently it’s neck and shoulder tension and jaw pain. I guess I’ve reached a point where I think ‘enough is enough’ and need to work to change this aspect of who I am, which has been ‘normal’ for 5/6 years. I find it hard to discipline myself with things like yoga, meditation and other mindfulness activities, because of the tension, but also the fear that it may not work. But if I never commit to it, it won’t have an effect. My GP told me to do a little bit each day so I get used to the practice of it.

I feel like I’ve hit another obstacle in my life, I just generally feel unhappy with life. I constantly worry about my girlfriends happiness which is putting a big strain on my relationship. I find i spiral out of control easily with my emotions , all it takes is something i dont agree with and I find myself in a pit of despair. I constantly argue with co workers. I always feel like I’ve forgotten to do something when there isn’t anything out standing. I feel empty inside, just surviving Im unsure what type of help I need , would counselling be right for me?",1,well_being_reddit_body

I'm also stressing about the same server, I only have 3 friends in that server some might leave in like a month or two some might leave in a year, so I want to spend as much time with them as I can same thing for the $300 I spent. I had to decide to get a job (In game) and wanted to be a police officer which I thought was really cool but in a previous situation the work of a police man in that server was really stressful which I realised from one annoying guy so I wanted to quit and be a prison guard which isn't that much of a fun job but I would be with my four friends who work together there. My dad (IRL) told me that I shouldn't quit something because of one annoying person since there are a lot of people who are going to be annoying in my life. I stress about multiple other things but those are not what are stressing me that much now anymore. I love this server and I want to continue playing on it.

We could not do it separately, nor together, we could not do it in more favorable situations, we cannot do it now it would simply be absurd.

There’s no need on making a great effort if it has to be useless.” “I consider the help (not yours but from anyone) useless given the situation, and I think time has proved me right.” “Everything has gone from bad to worse, it would be absurd to think that things could work out.” “In December I told you that no matter how much you wanted it was not viable, that it would become a struggle between you and depression and that we could not win in any way, and everything has happened like this, I am able to distinguish my thoughts from reality yet.” It is very heartbreaking to see him like this.

You got everything your way when you cried as a kid, so you're crying now in hopes that someone pities you. They'd called it stupidity, and realizing you're just a serial attention seeker will make that stupidity go away. It felt like a dagger was plunged into my chest when I read that.

I don't want people to give me nice words. On the contrary, I'd rather people be dicks to me. Self-loathing and such is a comfort feeling. And I know that makes me selfish. I harmed after that. I don't cut myself or anything, I'm too much of a stupid fucking pussy. I asphyxiate myself, typically with a chord. This time it was a long piece of plastic packaging that I wrapped around my neck. I've written about this here in the past. I've only recently come to the realization that I use it as a physical and psychological way to make myself feel awful and cause harm, rather than attempt to off myself. I just don't know of this counts as anything more since it doesn't leave a scar... it's probably just some silly dumb thing and nobody takes it seriously because I'm just being a fucking baby. Yeah. That. Well, whatever. Here I am, making a post. Because I'm a serial attention seeker that should just keep all of this inside so I don't spread my stupidity. Silly me.",1,well_being_reddit_body

She's normally been a great sleeper and has given us very little trouble at nightimes (or at least compared to some of the stories I hear from our parent friends - I know how lucky we are in this regard). Anyway, the last few weeks have been a slightly different story. I don't know why but she's been waking up and crying out for us in the night a few times more. Other than her nightime waking, she's also not been napping properly durng her day (denying us those precious few hours to get some jobs done without being interrupted or just having a quiet coffee). On top of this, both of our jobs have been horrendous (my wife and I work in health care, which is a tough sector to work in during a global health crisis). My wife is also recently pregnant and dealing (very admirably) with the whole morning sickness thing (I don't take for granted that she has a much tougher deal than me - you women are awesome!). Anyway, when my daughter called out for me an hour ago (it's 3 o'clock in the morning BTW), I had to steel myself to go into her room and settle her calmly. Anyway, I'm on her bedroom floor right now, watching her sleep and I've got my hand poking through the bars of her cot - she's holding my finger tightly and squeezing them every now and again as she breathes. The thoughts going through my head are these - one day, far sooner than I'd like I'm sure, she's going to want me to ""LEAVE ME ALONE"" because ""you're so embarrassing"" or ""you just don't get it!"".

1492,"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. Here's the breakdown with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months.

I have absolutely no idea how to make it stop, and my personal life is suffering. How do I teach myself to switch off after work?",1,well_being_reddit_body
1509,"I dont have a reason to be depressed but. Its just sometimes i feel fine and then all of a sudden i just dont want to do anything and i feel an ache in my chest. Idk man. I guess it might be that my parents arent able to bring in no money and its just in my conscious and pops out evry now and then. Am i just faking my ""depression""? Let me know if im the only one that feels like this? EDIT I just want to say that i tried responding to all the messages but i just got overwhelmed and got busy with trying to help my dad with work. but thank you to everyone who gave me words kf encouragement and i am deeply sorry to everyone who feels the same way. oh and thank you kind person for my first gold award! ) EDIT 2 Thank you to my second gold award. i really appreciate it alot. but you people really dont have to spend money to just give me a virtual award. but i an thankful and it does make me kinda feel wanted. thank you <3",1,well_being_reddit_body
