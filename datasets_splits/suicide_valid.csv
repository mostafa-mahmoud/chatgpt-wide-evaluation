2,"I don't want to live, but I don't want to dieThe thought of death terrifies me...the possibility that it's just blankness, and nothing else.  But I don't want to live. I'm stuck, have been stuck for 16 years. Everything has just gotten worse. I'm only 26 but I've worked so hard to get better, and then something happens and I end up worse than I was. I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of being me, of putting everything I wanted to do off until I'm in a better place...I never will be and can't do them unless I am. I am stuck and alone and fucking jaded.  So fucking stuck. I don't want to be me anymore. I wish I was somebody else. I wish I had someone else's' better life. I'm unfixable in so many ways. I wish I had more time and support. I just don't want to do it anymore",1,suicide
3,"I really don't know where to turn to anymore.I'm 32.i haven't had a stable place to call home since I was 8. Moving around here and there and as soon as things start going well and I move on the the next step in my plans for a better future, everything falls to shit. I've had to rebuild my life from scratch about nine times now. When I say from scratch, I mean the only thing I had to my name was a shitty phone and the clothes on my back. I'm done doing this over and over again for it to always end up this way. I can't do it anymore. I'm currently homeless, penniless, and hungry, sitting with the only things I own in life in my shitty car that won't go more than a mile without breaking down. I actually own the car! Can't even sell it though because I can't afford the insurance and it's a PoS! What else is there? I tried to get another job, but guess what? Credit Check!! And I recently got evicted from my apartment to I couldn't even get the job because of a fucking imaginary 3 digit bullshit number! I don't have family or friends I can go to get back on my feet and the state/city I live in is very expensive. Even if I did get a job, I couldn't even pay to get to work and at this point, that's too much time. I had goals and a plan and even motivation, but life keeps wanting to give me the good ole fuck you kick back down the stairs and this time I'm not getting back up. I'm stuck in an endless cycle that I've been dealing with for 24 years. I tried, I really did every single day of this worthless shitty existence. Nothing became of it. I failed at every turn. I'm tired y'all. I don't have the strength to keep doing this and every single time I've asked for help, I've always gotten the same bull. Oh, I'll pray for you, you can't give up, it'll get better. It doesn't for some people, it just keeps going on. I'm not asking for help anymore cause it doesn't do anything. I'm just asking for understanding. This is too difficult for one person to deal with while I see people that don't try a day in their life get rewarded. Throwing in the towel sounds 10 times better than going another 20 years of this.",1,suicide

Needless to say, It wasn't. I was uncomfortable. I hated every damn second of that world. I jumped back in same damn hole. Far away from any expectation, far away from any responsibility. Far away from happiness. I was once again trapped in nothingness, but this time knowing that out there is not better at all. I'm hopeless. And If not today, my days are numbered.

I could easily just scrap this and keep it to myself. But I want to give him something really special and I feel like this is it.  I also got him an actual preset but that won't be coming until after his birthday. While this I can give to him on his birthday. If you have any comments or advice please do tell!],0,suicide

Most people do the most out of this world crazy weird shit for attention but dont realize it's making people think bad about you, be chill around people, dap them up, if you got a popular friend hang around him and meet his friends, boom new friend group that people see you in and think ""oh, hes friends with them? He must be chill"" 2nd: TALK TO GIRLS, I swear I cannot stress this enough, download snapchat and add people from your school, start off by sending them snaps of you want it doesnt matter, but literally just start snapping back and forth with a girl and then you can start to have real conversations and then you can finally start to get somewhere. 3rd: cmon man, play a sport, I'm not saying you have to do this but socially it helps alot during school, you dont have to be good, just play sports, if you've never played sports before the 3 best things to join would be 1. Football  2. Wrestling (most people start there freshmen year of hs)  3. Track, theres something for you to do in track no matter your skillset. 4th: be confident, I want you to get up everyday, look in the mirror and think ""wow I'm hot as shit"" then look away, if you look at the mirror to long you start to overanalyze little things and it hurts your confidence, remember people see you as more attractive then you think you are so get tf up and act like it.

Whenever I'm not with her or in pain I feel nothing and I've been searching to feel something, so I've been resorting to pain and I'm freaking myself out because I'm starting to realise how psychotic I really am. I've been seen by a few therapists but I would always leave in the middle of a session and never return because I felt that they weren't helping me. But I think I'm starting to understand I'm just a psychopath. It's scary to become self aware of this. All I can think of is more and more intense things so I can feel something. I want to do large amounts of LSD. I want to strangle someone and watch the life drain from their eyes. I want to stab something and watch blood gush out of its body. I won't actually do these things because I know how serious the consequences are, but it scares me that this is what I feel inside and it all started when I decided I don't want to kill myself because I know my SO would kill herself too. That option was taken away from me and I'm going crazy.  I recently came home for winter break (I go to college) and bought her a cat for Christmas. I'm allergic to cats but I fell in love with this cat. She's a super young kitten and only has three legs but I love her. And when I got to spend time with my SO and the kitty for a few hours, I felt genuine happiness for the first time in months. But due to some other circumstances I probably won't be seeing them again till spring and I don't know that I'll be in the right mental state to keep it together till then without stabbing myself.

So either if I try to use a dating app or if I were to try to talk to people in real life then I couldn't do it. But if I'm on the internet or just typing it's easier. I feel like I have to get comfortable with someone first before I can try face to face. I feel like to date on dating apps would be hard and not using dating apps would be easier. But I also feel the same the other way around. That dating apps would be easier but dating in real life would be really hard for me. So I don't know if anybody would understand but I just have a lot of anxiety when talking to people. It's hard. Like really hard. And people don't understand.,1,suicide

162,"""No man is a failure who has friends"" -It's a Wonderful LifeHi, I think my time has come. I've felt pain year after year, but it's never from the same thing, it's always different. It's like god wanted me to feel every different type of pain. My life isn't that bad right now, but there's one key part that makes me want to end it all. That quote from the top is the only reason I've been alive for the past 3-4ish years. I mean I never told my friends my problems, but talking to them, talking to people always made me want to live. The problem was that I never got emotional with my friends and one by one they all faded away. Could be me pushing them away due to my lack of trust, naturally drifting apart, or they just were going somewhere else. And now because of mainly my actions, I have no friends. 3-4ish years ago I wanted to kill myself, I was going to, but I wasn't in a good position to do that, so I waited till I could. Then I saw it's a wonderful life and my perspective changed. I still wanted to kill myself, but I never did because I had friends. Now I have no friends, so all I can think of is that my time has come. It's time for me to die. I've had a plan just in case I ever wanted to. I hid a bunch of pain killers in my room, but there's more to my plan. When it's 2am I'm going to grab the pills, water, and a backpack and sneak out of my room. Then I'll go to the garage and get a razor. I don't really wanna die in a garage, so I plan on running 5 miles just to go to a park. Once I'm there I'll take the pills, sit down on a bench looking over the lake, take my shirt off to bite down on it, and cut myself. It seems like pure bliss, peace after all my torment. I plan on doing it tonight, but I'm fearful of what happens after death. Not because of the people around me, but because what if heaven and hell are real. Would I be sentenced to eternal damnation. That's what I fear. But I know it's time, I've been thinking about it all week. I just needed to write it down, so I'd know that it's actually happening. Goodbye",1,suicide

Nor do I do that to garner attention or be ""cool"" (I have always hated this word) I literally just exist and do what I like. With this recent trend of hating on teens acting a lot older makes me insecure of who I am. I curse a lot, smoke (thanks to family but I am very close to giving it up!) make sexual jokes, mess around with guys etc. Might I add I am a well behaved kid, have good grades, I don't do stupid shit like wearing provocative clothes/posting provocative pics online cause I think it is cheap and degrading. Haven't been with anyone older (am the age of consent in my country) although have playfully flirted with some older friends but absolutely nothing serious. Nor have I ever entered a situation where there's any danger because well, I know all too well. &amp;#x200B; Where is the problem? Well. I just fucking want to fit in! I just want to be whatever society wants me. I want to fit in and want every one to like me. My stupid age or my terrible personality is not something I can fucking change. Tried to change my personality a lot got more suicidal instead. I just want people to like me, see me as a person despite my age.  I am not immature as a person either, I take full responsibility for anything I do. The reason I am like this is a whole another shit show in itself. Hit puberty wayyy too early, got sexually abused by mom, and still getting verbally, physically, emotionally abused by parents lmao. I cannot act like act like a child as my parents expect me to (they still cannot expect I am not 12 and keeps calling me 12 in a condescending way even though I am well past that age.

I don't want to live like this.I'll try to keep it short since I've written this out many times in the past.   I've had depression since the age of 7. I'm currently 17. Back in October, I was about to kill myself, but my school counselor ended up talking me out of it. For about a year before that, my depression was really bad and I was dealing with terrible anxiety too (panic attacks, shaking uncontrollably, hard time breathing, crying at the thought of being around other people, passing out, etc).    Since then, I've been apathetic about my life. I just gave up on myself and decided to keep going because it made my parents happy. I wasn't really sad anymore, but I wasn't happy either. I was just really content.   I recently talked to my psychologist about it and she told me that it sounds like it was just a defense mechanism. She said it sounded like I was just going through so much that I subconsciously just ""pushed it all aside and said I didn't care.""    I had thought that my depression was actually starting to go away, but since hearing that, its all coming back now. I wasted my entire childhood being depressed. I just can't keep living if I have to deal with this again. I can already tell that my thoughts are less clear then they were in those few months. I'm having a hard time staying in class without crying. Its starting to bother me again that I don't fit in anywhere.   I don't know what to do anymore.

When I was a kid I played video games to distance myself from my shitty childhood. I have never been a social person. My parents divorced when I was 17. I played world of warcraft for five years and gained a lot of weight. When I graduated high school, my mother kicked me out of the house. I moved in with my dad in a different city. While away I had time to think and I realized that I was discontent with the way I was, a 280 lb fatass. I started working on losing the weight, and made it down to 138 before I realized that I was bulimic. Not the purging type, but the binge/restrict type, with the excessive exercise. But this year I hurt my knee, so I couldn't run any more. So I started swimming. 2-3+ miles a day. I did it so much that I hurt my elbows. And now here I am, unable to do any form of cardio and almost no lifting. I'm losing it, day by day. I can't live like this any more. Running kept me sane. Swimming let me eat.

It feels impossible that I'll ever fall in love and get married with the right person. My boyfriend is an asshole and doesn't have an ounce of empathy/selflessness, and it's been bringing me down horribly. He never takes me out on dates. He never says anything encouraging. He never does anything romantic for me. Will I ever have it? Why do I want to have a romantic relationship, filled with love and care so much? Why do I want the flowers? Why do I want to hold hands? Why do I want all these couple-y things? But it's unobtainable. I've never been interested in anyone that asks me out, except for my current boyfriend, but the honeymoon phase is over, and now he's showing his true colors of being an apathetic, unmotivated, bitter jerk. I used to think he was perfect. We had so much fun, and he would do those romantic things for me. But it's just ""not him"", and that was only a side effect of the honeymoon phase. Maybe I'm speaking out of emotion right now. I can't relate to the rest of society. I feel too deep. I'm fragile. People only ask me out because I'm decent looking. I'm a pushover. I care too much.

Why do I procrastinate so fucking much when I know I have to get shit done?

But I can't do those things without thinking of killing myself  Holding a knife? How about I stab myself with it? Turning on the stove? How about I let it burn me? I would think about those kinds of stuff when things went bad.  Then it all went downhill when she told me that teenagers aren't supposed to cry.

400,"How do you care about something when you know it's ultimately pointless?I've accepted that suicide is inevitable. Life is miserable and I've tried everything to make it better. It will only get worse as I get older. I've done years of therapy and medication and programs. Life remains miserable, painful, and pointless.  Right now I take care of my mom, who has a lot of health problems. I'm all she has. There's no one else to take care of her and we can't afford for her to be in a nursing home. She doesn't deserve to suffer the loss of child or have to be neglected.  Basically, I'm waiting for her to die so I can kill myself. I don't know when that will be. For the time being, I have to be alive.  I'm working on assignments for incomplete college classes. I'm finding it extremely difficult to work on or finish anything. I know that the work is pointless. I know it won't mean anything or improve my life in any way to do it. I have no desire to do it. And I'm pretty hopeless about even passing these classes even if I do the work. I've already had two professors change their mind about accepting it. I'm trying to get them to reconsider, but hopeless about that as well. If they don't accept it, I don't finish school. Financially we're totally fucked, so there's not an option to retake the classes.  I don't have a desire to finish. I don't aspire to anything. I'm just waiting to die. Rationally, I know it would be better to finish the classes, so I could qualify for some better job opportunities. I feel like I can't find any incentive, no matter what I tell myself or what scenarios I imagine, nothing encourages or motivates or inspires me to the work.  I'm going to be miserable no matter what I do, so why bother? I gave up on life a long time ago. I can't get myself to want anything other than death. It's why I couldn't finish these classes in the first place.  Before I die, I do think I'd like to finish this. The trouble I've had with school has caused me a lot of pain. It's definitely a significant factor in my decision to commit suicide and feelings of hopelessness.  That's not the right thing either though. I still don't care. ",1,suicide

484,"Post Graduation DepressionI've been empty since graduation. I've never been the happiest person, but I've really lost all hopes. I have no ambition or motivation left. My only thoughts are of sadness and a deep longing to no longer continue living the life I'm stuck living.. I have friends, yet I feel so alone.. I can't afford to leave this town or go to school, and even if I could, I don't know where I would go, or how I would somehow manage to push myself to do my schoolwork. Nobody is interested in me romantically, and the only person I've ever cared about deeply is no longer in my life. We had plans to get married..to share the rest of our lives with each other.. It hurts to be this afraid and alone with nobody to share my feelings with..nobody to even talk to. I can't talk to my family about these types of issues, and they don't care to take notice..even though I'm sure it's obvious at this point. I graduated last July, and I've been miserable since. I want to leave my life behind and run away..but I'm stuck. Stuck here..with my parents and people who don't care to notice how I'm feeling or doing. I need out of this town..away from this place..from everything.. I just really don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to give up but that's honestly the only option I can see happening at this point..I've got nobody and no reason to continue living a life without purpose. I don't want to end up on medicine that makes me feel like a zombie..because I don't feel that loosing the little emotion I have left will do anything to help me, but instead just make me feel worse. I feel the pressure to go to school but I can't justify the cost..or motivate myself to do the work and go to the classes. I don't want to be a slave to money until I die..what sort of life can that be.. I just don't know. Even these words feel useless at this point..like I'm talking to nobody in particular..but rather convincing myself I'd be better off dead. ",1,suicide

505,"Recruiting people to play Team Fortress 2 until valve gives us a major update or the bots go away. Day 15   The game is called Tf2 it's an FPS PC game made by the video game company Valve that also made the Half-life series. It's a really fun game. Main reason I am recruiting people is because if we can start increasing the monthly player number, Valve will get us an update or pay attention to us. Tf2 is a FPS game where there are different game modes such as payload, capture the point, king of the hill, and capture the intelligence. There are also alternative game modes where you can play with friends such as Mann vs. machine. If you don't feel like being a tryhard and playing the objective, you can hop into a 2fort or Hightower server and just mess around with friends. As it stands now, it is a F2P, however F2P can't use the chat or voice chat. However this can be easily solved by buying a key at the Mann.co store in-game for 2.50 (U.S. dollars). After the purchase its up to you if you want to buy more stuff. It also gives you the privilege of going competitive if you want. You can also buy cosmetics (if you want) and dress your character. Many Tf2 veterans refer to this as a hat simulator because of the amount of hats and cosmetics there are (at least I do). If you need help getting into the game or want more info, DM and I will be more than happy to respond. It would also help if you joined my newly created subreddit----&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/ReconstructingTf2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReconstructingTf2/) It's a subreddit dedicated to help reach out to new players and to reverse the inflation caused by the Crate Depressi",0,suicide

529,"*Update* - No plans. Only suicidal ideation. I need advice please.Hi, I forgot the password to my previous throwaway account. Here's the previous submission: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/yjl00/no_plans_only_suicidal_ideation_i_need_advice/ First some good news. My wife and I found a place, and she has a job. My father sent me $2000. So, financially I have some breathing room.  However, my wife's job isn't great, and it doesn't even begin to cover the depth of debt she accumulated - let alone our living expenses. The place we got is small and cheap. But my money will run out quickly.  I need to get a job, but I'm an American citizen living in Canada. My student visa expires in November, and the baby is due in December. I cannot work because I didn't graduate, I was kicked out of the master's program I was in. My degree is in philosophy, so it's not like that's of any help. My wife doesn't want to me to leave because she doesn't think she can handle being by herself in this situation. I'm not entirely sure what to do.  Still things are okay now, but I see another huge storm coming my way. I don't know if I will be prepared for that. If anybody has any advice, I would gladly take it!",1,suicide

In old age, you are too scared to die (you just keep on shovelling pills down your throat)? 6) Why are we a *bunch* of **cowards**? Pretty much everyone I have talked to about ending it all came to the conclusion that they have felt suicidal at some point in their life, but because time passes, you'll get through the **** too.

536,"Fiancé of 2 years left meLast night I (m/29) found out that my fiancé (f/23) of 2 years and partner of 5 total was leaving me. She calmly told me that she's been unhappy for a while but I had no real idea that this was the case as she never told me anything was really wrong. Over 3 hours she told me that she felt trapped and that she just didn't love me anymore. I asked her repeatedly if there was another person and she said no, it was just my flaws and she occasionally told me that she didn't deserve me.  She finally told me that she was going to bed and I broke down. I don't cry a lot usually and I haven't in several years but I just broke. Shortly after this I realized her MacBook was on the counter and I snooped (I know I shouldn't have). Of course I found a message pretty quickly from a guy that said that he has just told his wife that he wanted a divorce and for my fiancé not to text him back immediately. Of course I talked to my fiancé about this since it seemed too coincidental and she confirmed after several minutes of lying that she is leaving me for her District Boss!  She just started this new job last month and she's already convinced he's her soul mate. He's much older and from what she has told me he had put her on a pedestal at work and given her a lot of praise so far. I feel like he's preying on her because she showed no signs that she was unhappy. In fact, just last week she was overjoyed to find her wedding dress.  I don't know what to do. I love her so much and we share a house together. I want to be with her and I don't want her to make this mistake of being used by her boss or get out in a position where she could be sexually harassed if she wants to leave a relationship with him. I'm close to her family and all of our friends are shared but they're mostly hers.  I feel all alone now and I'm sitting in my bed overhearing her giggle from another bedroom on the phone with him. I know it's not worth it but I can't stop thinking about hanging myself. I'm trying to put it out of my mind but I just don't know how to deal with this. I lost my best friend and what feels like my whole life. ",1,suicide

540,"I am completely and utterly unlovable and it's all my fault.I'm sitting here at my nephew's birthday party with loads of happy people around me and I just want to cry. Yesterday I emotionally abused a boy I knew only three days. I absolutely loved everything about him, and most of all I loved that he seemed to genuinely like me. And what did I go and do? I couldn't believe that he liked me, so I kept sending him messages asking if he did, and if he didn't respond right away I'd want to cry. Eventually I took like 10 paracetamol (nowhere near enough to kill me) and told him I took pills. I did it as some sort of sick punishment for him doing absolutely nothing. And after I calmed down and told him to run as far away from me as he could he STILL wanted to at least be friends with me. If I continue to talk to him I *will* hurt him, and I want to tear myself apart. Hell I want to do it now. There is a balcony with a short drop outside. Maybe I can break my neck. I can't be loved because I make it impossible to love me. I want desperately - desperately - to love and be loved, but I can't do it. I can't. I want to sleep forever. Edit: I just sent him this message: &gt; I am complete poison to you. Run away as fast as you can. I promise I won't kill myself, but don't talk to me anymore. You need to do this because when I become emotional I won't be able to stop myself. Even if you just wanted to be friends I would continue to abuse and hurt you. I absolutely do not deserve forgiveness for my actions yesterday. I have known you three days and already taken pills and threatened suicide. This is not acceptavle behaviour. &gt; I'm not going to lie and tell you there isn't a part of me that hopes you'll read this and go ""Oh I'll never leave you"" but I am fighting very very hard against it.

542,"Some problems can't be talked out of.I reached the end a few years ago. I've been hanging out and waiting for the courage to kill myself but I've never been able to even in the most intense periods of pain. I wish I was stronger. There have been so many moments in my life where I wanted to kill myself but didn't, and I'm looking back and wishing I had the strength then to just get it done with. Life has been very negative as long as I can remember and once puberty hit and it became obvious where I was in the hierarchy life has been bleaker than bleak. It took me a while to realize it, everyone says I need to love myself but my entire life has been a drawn out process of losing any self-love through the realization that I'm a failure of a human being. My body could not be much worse, like literally if you listed what not to include in a human body of my gender you would have a description of me. And people do care about that, they think I'm mentally disabled or an idiot, and maybe I am. My entire life has been the slow realization that seeing myself positively is a lie, you don't forget that smug smirk in another person's face, especially once you've seen it hundreds if not thousands of times. There is nothing to look forward to, the only things I wanted and looked forward to are apparently too difficult for me to achieve, things like physical love and being touched positively. How sad is that?  There are teenagers more accomplished than me in junior high, and all the abstract things like degrees don't matter compared to the basic facts of life. The fact is I was born a loser and I will die a loser and every time I've tried to change that has been a humiliating experience of being put in my place. My family has blown me off for decades and my friends stole from me and talk shit, so I don't really have any friends. I've never experienced love, and for a long time, that was what kept me going. And I did everything in the name of being good enough, but the truth is that being good enough has NOTHING to do with being good enough. Days like today I just exist. There is nothing to look forward to, anything to work toward is a distraction and a lie, but I can't quite get myself to buy the gun yet. Can you help me get there?",1,suicide

Or am I so strong that I want to carry on? I hope that makes sense to someone I've mentioned it to friends before and they haven't been able to grasp the concept of it but that's probably because they get uncomfortable and don't know what to say.. but it's just- everyone always tells you how strong you are when your in times of mental struggle, but I find myself saying that if I wasn't so weak and afraid, I wouldn't be here.

If I'm that passionate about something that I would kill myself over it completely seriously, why would I hide it? My recent post on AITA about my boyfriend included me telling him I would kill myself if he continued to watch porn. My question is, should I just not mention I would kill myself, and then when he inevitably did watch porn again, I should just commit suicide? Sure it's a threat but if that's what's going to happen then they should get a heads up.  It's a long story, but essentially he kept lying about watching porn. I told him after the second time I found out that I would kill myself if he did it again. I've lost all my love for him ever since then and I broke up with him last night, and when I did, he admitted to everything he did including jacking it to porn when I went to my night class. He said since I was more confident I'd be fine learning the truth. The fact that he continued to do something I told him I would kill myself over (if I still loved him) made me so incredibly upset I actually am contemplating suicide again. I thought he was telling the truth this whole time and now my self esteem is the worst it's ever been.

Whether or not someone might try to  pull me away from the edge. One time I thought about what it would be like if I pulled my blanket over my head and allowed myself to suffocate. It may look like an  accident that way. Then I layed there for a while with the blanket covering my face. I knew it wouldn't kill me. I don't know what I was thinking honestly.

670,"School troubles.I graduated high school early July. I was accepted into the architecture program at private college I've had my eye on for awhile. But, it's expensive and out of state. I've been waiting to hear back from them because I reached out for a scholarship.  When I first started highschool, (Mexico's HS system is from the tenth grade to the ninth) I was dealing with very big mental health issues. I had moved from the USA to Mexico and it took a large toll on me, I had depression for two years. This of course, did show up on my grades. I didn't feel like I would ever graduate, I always thought I'd have the courage to kill myself before then. Until my last year of HS I was seeing some light and felt motivated.  For that year, my grades were average.   I was told that the results of my application would be up online yesterday. They weren't. I sent an email this morning and was told it would be pushed until the 30th. My first day of classes would be the 7th of August.  This whole situation is making me go back to my old state. I didn't sleep well last night because of other situations that are making my mental health worse. I keep going back to my suicidal thoughts. I don't know what to do. If I can't make it now, I'll never will. I'm not worth any help. ",1,suicide

Before that they would only ever really come when I was feeling down or depressed but at some point it progressed to any time that I was alone with myself. I could keep myself distracted by playing computer games, watching YouTube, watching movies, etc. But as soon as any of that stopped, my mind would drift back to those thoughts of suicide. It's always the same, I think about my martial arts belt, I imagine how the noose is to be tied, and then everything else that follows. If it's not that, it might be on the same stretch of road that I drive looking at that same pole at the end of a nice long straight stretch. If it's not that it's looking at every single car that passes me going the other way. Then it progressed to if I'm not actively trying to distract myself my mind would just snap back immediately to those thoughts. Like one of those stupid videos that loop automatically. Over and over. Now it has progressed to the point where even as I'm trying to distract myself, I still have those thoughts rolling around in my head. It's like the little video is stuck on loop in another browser tab or something and never goes away. I can be in the middle of a conversation with someone and trying to pay attention but I just keep on thinking about it. There have been so many events that just keep on chipping away at me.

Well, she was late today and I didn't get my hug. Which was ok because I'd knew I'd see her at the end of the day. I didn't really talk to anyone too much today, just tried to focus on not getting in my own head. It was raining all day and I didn't get my hug at the end of the school day either which sucked.

Now I have no degree, over 20k in debt, no way to get my hands on my transcripts because I still owe the school room and board (a year of credits wasted). The 6k I owe them just went to the attorney general so now I probably won't even get a tax return. All I do is get underpaid as a programmer ($9 an hour, live in the actual fucking middle of nowhere so there's nothing better around and I don't make enough to move anyways). I have been actively fucking trying to get better. I have been on countless meds, none of them work. I go to group therapy most days during the week. The coping skills they teach don't make my fucking debt go away. They don't cure me being chronically single and rejected since I've been old enough to date. I don't have the energy or motivation to look for a better job. I don't have any self confidence left to try and get dates anymore (I can't even manage to get one date, I've been on one date in my whole life and it's now been over a year since then.)

For a time it felt like I was in control again, my doctor even said I was getting better and would slowly be weaned off.  Even though I'm 10x better than what I was like before I still feel like the world would be better off without me. These feelings aren't out of depression either. I've started to put 'the mask' on making people believe I am better when I'm still struggling. I feel quite weird for still thinking the world would be better off without me. I have enough saved up so I could even pay for my own funeral if I wanted to.  I even turned to religion looking for a answer, but because of the depression I had before I know everyone's true intentions. I went to a Christian school for most of my life until I graduated a few years ago. I know all about ""god being good"" and such.

I broke down most of the walls and am rarely depressed. Yet I still feel like my life isn't worth living even tho it's getting better. I guess you could say I feel 'bored' of living.

Then just recently she came back and was like ""what ever happened to the pokemon 'I' bought you""  So that's how my 2017 was and what happened now they were worth a fuck ton  I remember we counted them all out and we had 520 around there is what I remember  We even had first edition shiny charizard, that was bought for us for like $1200 by our uncle, and our two aunts Most of the cards were most likely worth almost nothing even now but that charzard is what I regret",0,suicide

734,"Any advice?I've been depressed ever since I was 9, so almost 10 years ago. I see no point in living, I've lost hope in my life improving. I spend every day like a mindless zombie doing menial tasks and just waiting for the night to come so I can fall asleep so I can repeat everything the next day. But the worst thing about this is that I have no idea how to help myself. I don't know what my goals in life are, I don't know what makes me happy. I see no purpose in life. This is killing me. I feel like my personality is incompatible with this world. I spend some days thoroughly analysing the life decisions I could make, the paths I could take, but nothing satisfies me. I see no purpose in having a family or focusing on my career/academia or pursuing my few interests or developing my relationships with people. I feel like I was born in the wrong time and place and therefore I am destined to lead an unhappy life. There's nothing I can do about it. I just want to go somewhere far away, some place different from where I am now. I'm basically defined by wanderlust.  I remember reading in a book a quote attributed to Machiavelli saying something along the lines of person being happy when he acts in accordance to the time he was born in, and unhappy when he doesn't.  I feel like I'm that latter person and that my wishes and dreams don't align with the world I was born in. But what bothers me most is that every once in a while I get a day where I feel like I'm on top of the world, like everything is going to be ok, I feel extatic. I genuinely enjoy living on those days and am glad I hadn't killed myself. But those days are few and far between. The last time I had one was the 23rd of June. These days are then almost laways followed by a period of increased depression and the worst pain imaginable. I don't really want to kill myself but I feel like it's the only antidote to my dissatisfaction with life.  What can I do to at least remotely help myself? To find a purpose? P.S. I'm also absolutely horrified about the concept of aging. I feel like my time is running out.",1,suicide

I've seen it coming from miles away and I share my evidence with a bystander. This bystander can not interfere with the natural course due to their nature of being a bystander. And then I unsave memories, conversations, and messages. It's usually snapchat so what I unsave if gone on their end as well. I take them off my private. I do more things by myself.

785,"I'm lost. So I have this one English teacher. She's in the middle of strict and mean, but more on the mean side. Out of everyone in my class, it seems like she likes me the least. Today she was having conferences with everybody about our essays to get into high school. When it was my turn, as soon as I approached her desk she said: ""girl, goodbye"" and everyone kind of snickered at it. I think the reason she said this was because she must've forgotten that I told her that I would redo my essay, because the first one I wrote wasn't so good. I just don't know what to do anymore, because she's one of the people who has to write my high school recommendations. All my other classes aren't solid either.

He often doesn't leave the house for weeks on end, because he has nowhere to go. He has no future prospects. I'm scared he feels as horrible as I do all the time. I'm scared he's going to kill himself, but I'm also scared that he feels like he has to continue living in pain because he doesn't want to hurt us.  I was going through my instagram feed and realised that my ""friends"" all have groups of friends that they hang out with. They were having dinner together and going out.

Touches me down there (and lets me touch her boobs...). But when one of our friends say something like: you two should kiss or something similar, she inmediately refuses it and even sometimes gets annoyed with the person who said it.

807,"Authoritarian Parenting  Hello, everyone For some background, I'm an Chinese-American sophomore in high school, and both of my parents are Chinese.  These days, I'm having a lot of pressure from my parents for me to literally do as much schoolwork as humanly possible, even when I've finished my obligations for not only my classes but also for the AP classes that I take in a third-party institution. They just force me to pile on more and more work.  This has gotten to a point in which I cannot even read a book of my choice without being told to find more work for myself, as though it seems as if I have too much time on my hands (much less take some time off to watch a YouTube video from time to time).  Their reasoning for this is that the children of their peers seem to be doing better than me academically, so they think that the only way for me to ""catch up"" is to devote as much time as humanly possible towards studying, because that's apparently ""what everyone else is doing"".  They are now threatening me that if I don't do ""what a student is supposed to do"", they will send me to China to study, and ""see how the Chinese kids study"", without realizing that these poor Chinese kids also take one singular exam that literally define the course of their entire lives, and it's a much different world than the United States. I've also got my future planned out in the United States, as I wish to become a real estate agent.  I personally feel that this is a far too authoritarian (and perhaps even ego-driven) approach to this problem, and I don't know what to do about it as there is very little chance of me ever convincing them that they are being far too extreme. My GPA isn't the reason why I exist on this earth, and neither should it have to be the reason.  Anyway, what do you guys think about this? Do my parents have the right to do this? Or is it even morally right for them to do this?

I did my best for the past 6 years, I tried to improved myself, I exercise, meditate, and learn new things everyday, and do well at school and persevere a lot but even whatever I achieved I still feel empty, I usually isolate myself from my friends, because I am just too anxious, when I try to face my fear, I am left feeling sad and lonely. I love music, I am an aspiring singer songwriter, I write a lot of songs and music is just the only thing I am living for but my interest of it is fading away, I guess my depression is getting worse. And plus I live in a third world country where people, especially older adult people, stigmatise mental health disorders and even though my mom and dad wants to help me, they can't because of financial issues, and my family is just fucked up. I did well on my class this semester, but I don't feel anything about it, I think I'm just gonna end up becoming a corporate slave, working a 9/5 job that I don't give a fuck about, and live miserable, which is my worse nightmare. I just wanna kill myself honestly, I am lonely, depressed, and insecure. I feel nothing, I just want to end the suffering.",1,suicide

I've been promoted before peers. I have a wife and a 7 yr old daughter. My daughter is the one thing I cherish most. I grew up poor in a rural area in NC. Drunk/abusive father, miserable mother, 5 siblings. I've been drinking a lot the past few years, my wife has been cheating on me and I've recently found out it was happening while I was deployed. I was witnessing stacks and stacks of bodies as my wife is fucking around. I confront her and she says she's depressed and wants to die because her Dad, who she only met 3 times, died.  Guilt tripping me into staying. But I'm separated from her, trying to get custody of my daughter. Because my wife is a shitty and useless parent. But....suicidal ideations have been creeping on me for years. Now...I have selected the Black Forest to drown myself in a lake. My daughter gets everything. How can I have a decent life and all these horrible ideations? Drinking myself to death is something else I'm concerned with before I do that. I fucking hate myself.

Today, that thought popped into my head and quite frankly scared the living shit out of me.  A few years ago, I was ready. I had it all planned out. Letter's written. Everything. My parents were on vacation. I had stayed home because I had band rehearsals mid summer for the upcoming season. I'm not sure why, but one of my dearest friends showed up at my house to watch our favorite musical. (Phantom of the Opera) Her arrival was not planned or expected. She ended up spending the night and we stayed up all night and just talked. If it was not for her, I would not be here today. I have never told her this and probably never will. She is in my life today and that is all I'm worried about.  Fast forward to today. I have been going through a lot lately. I have been under a tremendous amount of stress. Anxiety has been extremely high. I've been feeling very very alone lately. I live in a city where my closest family member is over an hour away. My boyfriend just left me. I work with what feels like 24/7. I have absolutely no friends that I can turn too.. and I thought to myself, ""no one gives a shit about you. If you were to disappear, no one is going to notice.""

So the other day she litterally called us xenophobes because me and my friend are vocal about hating the Chinese government, and freaking yells at us while we say ""no that isn't how it works"", and litterally both said that we have nothing against the chinese and actually want the best for them in getting rid of their evil regime.

I can use the computer here to talk and post stuff like this, although I'm more of a lurker. Anyway 3 years ago I was having a rough time and talked with someone on this site. I stopped and left Reddit for a while and came back and didn't talk to them for a couple years because I was embarrassed. But I haven't eaten in a week. I'm trying to sell my steam account, which is not working at all, to get some funds to eat. But I asked a favor of thisperson. A couple bucks to get some food. They said sure. They didn't reply for a while and when they did, they said I was stalking them. That they couldn't help me. I have no idea where this came from when the last message from them was ""Sure how can I help?""  Hope in humanity is ruined. Hope in general. I swallow my pride, I do some thing I loathe and ask for help. Then they shit in my face...  Talk me out of killing myself here. I can't go to food banks because I do not have the right id. Soup kitchens are not close by and I lose my place to sleep indoors if I travel there and back due to time and distance. I can't afford to eat. I have no friends. No family. No one at all.

926,"Advise from a human about humans Here is a post about being a good human. It applies to everyone boys, girls, LGBTQ+ communities.  **- Support others**: It is very easy to do just help others when they are in need, it might come to a surprise but simply helping others increases the chance of others helping You when you are in need. \- **Respect your parents**: Just keep in mind they could have a star achiever instead they have you, respecting your parents is the least you can do to help them. \-**Control your anger**: controlling your anger is easier said than done. While anger is a perfectly normal emotion, you can't let it fester. When this happens, you may make unwise decisions, and more importantly, it may affect your health. \-**Accept responsibility:** Stop blaming others when you mess up things, take control of your life when you accept that you alone are responsible for your actions  **-Be polite**: Being polite is a small act of kindness we can do for everyone we come across.

994,"I've been having suicidal thoughts for more than five years. My girlfriend left me a few weeks ago and I think this is pretty much it.I don't really know what to say. My depression started almost six years ago, when my dad passed. I saw him pulled out of the water by EMS and his whole body purple. My brother was still at the store where he called 911 being talked to by EMS. I covered my moms eyes when he was pulled out, so I was the only one who saw it. Ever since then, it's like I've had to clutter my life with noise in order to forget about the depression. Sex, drugs, music, driving, a combination, something. anything to get away from the silence. I astronomically hate silence. I start to panic and get mighty anxious if I'm alone and it's quiet.  A few years after he passed, I found someone who shared my darkness. She was the love of my life, the only one who truly understands where i am. She was essentially a permanent noise, something that let me channel the darkness into something tolerable. I put all my faith into her. And a week ago, she left me. Leaving is one thing, i understand people have problems. But she just left. The only reason she gave was that she's not in love with me anymore. She doesn't care to talk to me, check up on me, whatever. It's like she wants nothing to do with me. How do you move forward from that? When someone you spent almost 5 years with just leaves without a thought of you like a candy bar you bought while drunk on the weekend.  Speaking of drunk, I'm drunk almost all the time. I'm drunk at work, drunk at home, drunk at the mall, drunk wherever. And I'm completely sober right now. It's when I'm sober that I feel like I don't want anything to do with this world.

Just now using memories not related to the depression waves, I pinpointed the exact time they all happened. June or July 2017, it lasted less then 24 hours November 2017, it lasted I believe 3 days February 2018, it lasted  5 days April 2018, it lasted 3 days I'm not sure about this one but I know I'm missing one, so it has to be this one: in beginning-mid of 2019... I don't remember exactly. But I believe it lasted over a week or maybe even two weeks with sucidal thoughts towards the beginning-end (no, I am not sucidal, nor do i attempt to do it) And recently June 28-July 28. It started out with me loosing most of my interests over the next week period. Unlike my other waves which I immidatly lost all interests. And around July 12-27 was the worst I ever had imo.  Now it back since a week, but it's not as bad. I still have interests and all, I just feel sad deep inside cause I'm lonely irl. And that's been the cause of my problems ever since, due to loneliness. Only this time the sucidal thoughts are there but not as much (again, I am not sucidal, nor do i attempt to do it). I have even considered self-harm to help deal with the emotional pain but I'm strong enough not to and just suffer the wave out like the other years. Considering this year I have online friends it's easier as I sometimes feel less lonely but is still difficult. I know how to cope with it and I have considered an online therapist. But I've done my research on these topics as I support others. Professionals just won't be able to help. What I have tho isn't depression yet. It's minor or as I often reffer to it as ""semi-depression"". I know I'll make it through this one as I've made it through the others with no support whatsoever. Even now i don't rely on a support. But I do have questions tho? Why is this happening like waves? Why is it means, like is it supposed to mean something? Or the one thing I don't understand is, how the hell am I strong enough to tackle it on my own without any help from anyone??? Idk.. this sounds more like a rant rn...",0,suicide

My father is a doctor and as so we have a lot of medicine at home that isn't used, but i wouldn't want to die of an OD unless it's heroin since i know the effects of drugs/medicine and i dont want to mess around and force myself in a position where i can't do anything anymore, but we do have some heavy sleep inducing medicine at home. So the question is, if i would get high one last time, take a few ""sleepy pills"" and choke myself, would that end it?  i somehow i still couldn't end it if i was sober enough, but also think that if i'm too high of the medicine i'd might ""Slip up"" and end up not killing myself, is my plan failproof or does it have too many loose ends?",1,suicide

Tonight I was feeling severely upset and decided to walk to the gas station to buy cigarettes. The whole walk there and back all I could think about was killing myself. I've had suicidal thoughts for years and I've made a few half-hearted attempts in the past, but I always get too scared to actually do it.  I was in therapy for about a year and on anti-depressants for most of that time. None of it seemed to help at all. I know people care about me and my life has not been the least bit difficult, but I still can't stop thinking about it. I think about killing myself almost every day. I've tried getting out more, getting more exercise, I even joined the army thinking it would fix my life. Nothing has worked. Recently I've thought about volunteering locally to fill my free time and give me something to feel good about, but my internet searches didn't turn up anything in my area and now I've run out of ideas.

1100,"I feel nothing at all. No anger, sadness. Just a void.Suppose I've dropped a number of threads here over the years, many of them quite aggressive. I was usually in a pretty angry state of mind (self-directed, largely), but it feels different this time. More specifically, it feels like nothing. There's a sort of neutral state we get in, where we do not feel strongly about things. It's easy to recognize, because we will become angry, or happy, or some number of possible reactions to things going on around us. A humorous image, an infuriating internet comment, these things evoke a response in a neutral mindset. This isn't that. I feel nothing. Spent some time browsing various things to try evoking a response, but there is none. Went out today, since it usually flares up panic responses. I felt nothing. I just existed in these times and places, present but not really living in those moments. I can feel myself responding to things said in ways people expect, but they're programmed responses. Things I know others want to hear. I don't mean any of it. The closest I've gotten to feeling anything over the last 3 days has been hugs from my wife. There's something there, it stirs briefly before disappearing again. I do care about her a great deal, one of the few things in the world I genuinely care for. It's strange I should feel so muted about it. I don't think I like it. Wasn't sure where else to say this. I don't know what it means. It isn't passing, as these episodes normally do.

No matter what I do, in the end I'm still one tiny speck of the universe in some pathetic little moment of time and in the end I'll be dead and so will everyone I might be able to affect, for better or for worse.This did not make me suicidal; it merely stripped away my... god, I hate the phrase ""will to live,"" it's so cheesy, but... well, everything felt purposeless and hollow. I'm sorry for how lame this sounds; I really don't know how to make this seem like something less pathetic. Then came the guilt. Unlike many people, I have never had anything horrible happen to me; I was never abused, and I've been pretty free of any terrible traumatic events. I've spent most of my life completely mentally normal. Compared to all these people, I have no fucking right to feel bad about myself. I'm free of any of these problems, and I still felt bad about the things in the above paragraph- and that, I figure, makes me weak. I'm so pathetic that I, all middle class and clever and white, am still bothered by this existential bullshit. I am completely disgusting for this. And that's where I started getting suicidal. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't trust anyone enough to tell them; I'm worried they'd either laugh at me or panic and call some kind of therapist. But there's nothing wrong with me, mentally; I don't think that'd help. I'm just weak. That's all. There's no cure for that. I'm sorry for the lame bullshit above.

I found it hard to deal with, so I'd usually be incredibly depressed during class and I'd have to leave on huge bathroom breaks. I talked to my friends about it, and they suggested I tell her. Which I did. My reasoning, I explained to her, was that because of this crush, it'd be easier if I could just switch her class to a study hall after our music performances, since i wouldn't be missing anything. She seemed okay with it, and she said she'd do whatever she needed to to make me feel more ""comfortable"". I told her it wasn't a big deal and not to worry about it anymore, and she said that she really didn't care. So i came back from easter break, was called down to the guidance office, and inside were the teacher, the counselor, and the vice principle. they explained that they knew about everything and that they were there to ""talk"".  I'm so fucking embarrassed. Why did she do this? Why couldn't she just let me drop and be fine with it? She didn't even act like she cared. She still doesn't. All I can think about is that she cares about me so little that she wanted someone else to deal with it, or it made her so uncomfortable that she felt this was the thing to do. Not only am I dealing with the embarrassment involved in the situation (the principal is friends with my dad), but I have to deal with the rejection. I really loved her. I just feel so stupid for telling her that now I want to kill myself. I keep thinking about ways to do it that would look like an accident, so my family wouldn't be as hurt. I can't go to her class anymore. It makes me sick. I know that in the future when I fall in love I'm only going to think about the horrible possible consequences, like this one. And my parents will never accept it. And my whole family. And friends. I know that if I TRY to kill myself, or check myself into a mental hospital or something like that, that information will be on my record and I probably won't be able to go to college or get a decent job.

I should of called the cops. But fear left me paralyzed most of the time. After I graduated he shot himself. I felt nothing when I found the body. That was a year ago. Nothing's changed really. I'm still afraid all the time. I've spent my entire life being terrified. It's stuck on me. I grew up in what most people describe as a war zone. My kind mother fighting my father, a sick twisted psychopath who enjoyed making others feel less than human, and watching them suffer and humiliating them, screaming horrible things that never made sense. It was terrifying. He reduced us to less than human. The worst stories you've read about how cruel one person can be to another was everyday of my life. Like we we're his personal slaves. I don't recall much of what was said. It's just him screaming at the top of his lungs whatever sick thing he could think of. Incest. Rape. Racism. Murder. Screaming at my 4 yr old sister that she's a dirty fucking whore nigger. Whatever he could say to make you wish you were dead. There was no reason, if he got angry about anything suddenly we were his metaphorical punching bags. My mother doesn't understand how dead inside I am. For her that was a bad chapter in her life. Me? That's how I was raised. To feel nothing. To be empty. But fear or hate. I don't want to go on anymore. Even getting stoned doesn't help. I don't know what it is to feel anything else. I just want to stop. I've already lived through hell. I don't want to go on anymore. I don't want to make friends, get in shape and get a gf, give my life meaning or any of that crap. I just want to die. ",1,suicide
1143,"I'm 27 and still live at homeMy parents don't take me seriously and my father is verbally abusive. Last week I cut my finger accidentally while chopping ginger. I went to put a band aid on it and he joked that it looked like a suicide attempt. I said suicide is nothing to joke about, yet he said I had no sense of humor.  My family's Evangelical Christian while I'm agnostic. I am also bisexual, yet prefer women over men. My last partner said I was humiliating and embarrassing to be around. I've never had a fulfilling relationship where I can look back with good memories. The partners I've had before her were also abusive. One raped me as well and fucked with my mind. One case: he knew I have a phobia against dolls and mannequins and would joke that he'd lock me in a room full of them in the dark.  My family combined with a lack of a love life drive me to believe I shouldn't be alive. The only thing I have going on is my school. My family do not help me with paying for college. I've worked full-time through college to pay for my tuition and text books. I started at a community college, and am finishing at an elite private school.  I just need love and support, especially when I'm at the restaurant answering phone calls and taking shit from bad customers. I wish I could have my own life, but the money I make isn't enough to support myself outside the home. I grew up and still live in NYC. The rent is way too expensive, even with a roommate, and I'm on a waiting list for affordable housing. I don't want to bother people I know to sleep on their couch. My father is too invested in his own projects to help me, none of which are successful and make him file for bankruptcy.  I'm debating if I should check myself into a hospital, but that'd overturn my heavy school/work schedule. I don't know what to do. ",1,suicide

I've been dehydrated the last few days and so I told myself i would do my best to drink as much as I could today. Just water trying to avoid soda. My stomach didn't want to accept food or water today as everything just made me feel nausious. so I got into benge watching various medical things because thats what I do when I'm depressed. I benge watch/listen to what is currently interesting to me. Hubby comes home and instantly lays down to nap. Didn't even have a chance to tell him I was feeling horrid and needed to talk.  He gets up and complains about me sitting in the bedroom all day and didn't even give me a chance to tell him i was in the PC room most of the time I was awake. The only thing I managed to get myself to do today is wash a single pan (water was acutally working today) and even I did that wrong as I washed the wrong pan. could have sworn he said wash the pan in the sink. there was only one. Since I thought he needed that pan for dinner I didn't want to dirty it again to make my lunch (fish he bougth for me). well didn't matter anyway. He angerly comments on both not cleaning the right pan and for not eating the fish he bought for me.... I dont even mention that he forgot to pick me up the bananas I asked him to pick up.  so not only feeling heavily suicidal before he comes home, now I feel worthless and hopeless ontop of it that I cant do anything right..... and just yesterday he was saying how proud he was for me doing better.... he knows I suffer heavy depression along with an illness that causes cronic pain and most of the time he knows to not comment on anything when I'm having a bad day... so in short. havn't eaten and barely drank anything all day due to being so depressed I feel physically ill....and hubby comes home and makes it a million times worse. soory just ranting here. ignore if you want.",1,suicide

My therapist doesn't do anything when I tell her I will commit suicide. I was never happy, until last monday, I met my best friends friend who came from the US to my country to visit her. She is absolutely stunning, most beautiful girl I have seen, also nice, smart, and I was her first hook up (we are both 16). i have no idea how but I managed to get her to like me, I usually have no luck with girls, but less with girls who were models. We hooked up like 10 times in the last 5 days, but she is leaving back to the US, and I know I will never find anyone like that ever again, I am still hooked to her. I know this is the typical whiny 16 year old bullshit. But really I love her, and it has got me down. the only thing I will have of her is a picture we took kissing. She doesn't want to date due to the distance. I have severe depression (actually diagnosed) but my therapist doesnt want to give me medicine, instead she doesnt help at all. ",1,suicide

1195,"I wish I'd get a terminal illness and I feel so fucking guilty for that.I'm a 26 year old female, single, a mortician by trade. I'm an only child, my parents both adore me and understand my issues, and I have three cats that I see as my children. I'm extremely content with my career. Diagnosed major depressive disorder, OCD, social and general anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder, and chronic PTSD. Due to multiple life events recently piling up all at once in tandem with my depression getting worse despite responding well to my new medication, I'm just starting to feel like I can't take much more. I do have a therapist, but I don't feel safe going to see her because I have an immunocompromised dad that I'm terrified of infecting and killing and my insurance doesn't cover remote therapy. I've been having more crying spells and intrusive suicidal ideation, it's getting constant and it's scaring me. I even know exactly how I'd do it (which I will NOT be divulging). But I can't destroy my mom and dad that way, and my cats would never understand why mom is gone. Honestly I wish I would just come down with cancer or something likewise terminal. I vape like crazy and work around formaldehyde, surely that'll catch up to me? I guess I just want my death to be taken out of my hands because I can't do it myself. And I feel so fucking guilty for actively desiring an illness that causes untold pain to the afflicted and their families, a disease most decent people would never wish even on their worst enemy. I've embalmed so many cancer patients and nearly all were wasted to nothing, and their families had to watch it all in all its agonizing glory. I'm not in active danger.

Not eventful/interesting at all don't expect some alcohol fueled escapade because it's not that at all) I was just a little tipsy, or else I wouldn't remember this. My mom was asleep upstairs and I was alone for the night. I had already started drinking a while back but I was only doing a few sips for taste. But we had just had a barbeque the previous day so there was a lot of booze left over that I could take some from the top without her noticing.  So I had some whiskey, then a little bit more, then I had some cognac. Then I thought, I always see those niggas mixing vodka and orange juice let me try that. I was a already starting to feel it from the other drinks so when I went to pour some vodka in the orange juice, I poured way more then intended. I said I wasn't going to drink it all because that was too much booze, but I drank it all.  That's when I really started to feel it. I wanted a few more drinks after that but stopped myself because I was feeling a little tipsy. Nothing much happen, I just stumbled around a little bit and giggled at the fact that I had fucked around and got drunk. I was watching tv but couldn't focus anymore so I went to sleep.

Weeks, months and years later i was not feeling better, my favorite things became boring, everything became boring, nothing made sense (in a existential way), i became fat (was a soccer player in college), i started to think that i was a person that my friends didn't like, just live with, that the girls who i dated were with me fot pity, and one of those were maybe my first love but i fucked up everything (like aways). More time passed and this awful feeling became bigger and bigger and i decided to kill my self, i planned every thing but in THE day i was too drunk and afraid that i couldnt do it, because i was weak and i knew that i would hurt my family so bad. After that i went for help (2015) and till today im using medications and im feeling better, really, i do things like a normal person, work, study etc. but i still cant see color in life. Im not like before when i had actually desired my family to die so i could kill my self without guilt, but im not feeling good. When i have bad days like today, i cant sleep thinkig about so many bad stuff, some of then i know domt make sense and sometimes i just feel very bad without reason. Mental ilness is like that, we feel bad for things that exist, things that we made up and sometimes for no reason. Im writing this to remember that i have a diasease but no matters what i say to myself there is people who cares for me, love me, an I love them too.

1240,"Existential crisis, failing my own rules. (x-post from r/depression)Ever since my sophomore year in high school I've struggled with recurring existential crises. I educated myself in a bit of existentialism and absurdism, and came to the conclusion that I should try to live my life to the fullest and be as free as I can. To put it simply, a large portion of my (atypical) depression is that I almost always choose the path of least resistance and I let myself be ruled by petty, incompetent, or oppressive authority figures. I would dismiss my concerns as unreasonable if it weren't for many people living these dreams (most notably in my opinion, Hunter S. Thompson). Fight Club and Thus Spoke Zarathustra delivered important messages to me: that it is up to me, and me alone to take my life into my own hands and live in spite of absurdity and social control. And, perhaps most importantly, to make my time spent here worth the effort. But I almost always choose the safer, more passive routes in life, and I don't, can't, and won't forgive myself for my weakness. A couple lines from Fight Club help explain where I'm coming from: ""This is your life, good to the last drop. Nothing gets any better than this. This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time."" (I may have messed the lines up, but oh well.) My time spent here is precious, I should be living it up to Dionysian extremes. But, to get back to the point, I want some advise r/depression. What should I do? (I'm posting this here because I find myself thinking about suicide with some regularity.

1269,"Feeling like a prisoner in my own lifeI basically just feel like i'm prisoner, I can't imagine a futur for myself, my days are the same and i'm feeling forced to do what im doing. After being bullied a lot durng school, I stopped it and stood at home for multiple years, playing online video games and making friends on it, it helped me escaping real life and the thoughts of killing myself. Years later, 21, i havent done anything with my life, lot of shit happened making it even worse, i didnt really go outside through these years, i have no friends around my city, all are eirher from different countries or at the opposite side of it.    I recently got a small job on internet that gives me 700$/month, it helps me making my mind busy so i dont think a lot, but i dont di anything beside this, listening to music (linkin park hello), i even almost dont play video games anymore when i used to do it  lot every day for years. I feel like my futur is pointless, i dont feel the courage to do anything like going outside, the main reason being that i have nobody to hang out with, i cant find any positive point in my life, i dont feel like i can enjoy anything, even when il trying to, i fail. I feel like i cant get a normal life again, feel like i'm ugly and mainly worthless. I never achieved anything good in my life and never made anyone proud, each day feel like being in jail, i just feel forced to keep on breathing, i recently was in a long distance relationship, during these 2 months my depressive thoughts were gone, i felt happy, the reason i got my actual job is bcs i wanted money to visit the girl, but it didnt happen because she ended it before, which gave me the depression back with an even bigger pain. If i dont keep myself busy i just overthink, think avout death and try to tbink about a way to kms without pain. Id like to be happy but i feel like whatever i do isnt enough, and when i manage to feel happy, something quickly happens to break it all  I just feel like i dont have any strenght left to get up, go outside on a regular basis or finding anything that makes me happy, im just totaly dead inside and fake to be happy",1,suicide

1281,"Short Online School Review (by u/1-STARrating) Spoiler Alert: no, it's not going to be a 1 STAR rating Ok, so online school's been going on for about 3 weeks already and tbh, it's more exhausting than face-to-face school. There's definitely a sharp increase in homework compared to last year but the plus side to this is that I don't forget about them, so in that aspect, the online school makes it more productive for homework, especially when every single activity that you do is at home. The downside to that is the stress really starts to kick in, having headaches and added pressure onto me. One of my teachers said it's just because we haven't adjusted to this ""new normal"" yet, so we'll wait and see how that will work out. Alright, let's get to the most significant of online school: the learning. While it is more exhausting than normal school, my memory still retains these lessons the same way they did last year: by forgetting about them the next lesson only to be brought back up again for the periodical exam. Really, this is just how the education system works in my country, it's in no way the online school's fault but it contributes to it.  Overall, online school is fine. It's not trash by any means (only if you have a decent connection), and it improves on some aspects of learning, but I still prefer normal school, because I get to formally stalk on my crush. At the end of the day, this is just one of the ways on how to deal with *""tHeSe UnPrEcEnDeNtEd TiMeS""*. This is only a band-aid solution to the large problem that we are facing today, and hopefully, we might get back to normal school in a year or two. I will demerit points to them for how much stress they've given me though, it's infuriating. #FINAL SCORE: 6/10",0,suicide

I'm a sociopath, I'm very smart, and I come from a (lower?) middle class family 40-50k/yr (family of four). I can do my school work, I can get good grades, but what's the fucking point? I can't keep up a conversation for two sentences before slurring a word, because when I was a little kid, my parents had me in all these places because ""I had no filter"", or ""I couldn't control myself"". Now, during a conversation, I question every word I say, ""did I sound stupid?"" ""Did I offend them?"" ""Was there a better word I could have used there?"". All of this contributes to my inability to hold up a conversation. I can't wait for college, not that I could even afford it. I recently accepted that I was gay, which, in itself, fucking sucks. Literally. My friend group isn't small, but I get the feeling that none of them really give a fuck about me. Who does? My parents don't. My dad is too busy with his shitty job, and my mom with being just a goddamn fuckwit. My mom always manipulates my dad, if I got a C on my report card, she'll call him and start screaming how in flunking out of fucking school, but he'll never care enough to look at the report card, he just believes everything she says, and runs straight to yell at me. My dads pretty cool, much better than my mom, but he's so easily manipulated, and just plain stupid. I have oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder (same thing ?), OCD, and ADD. My mom had been smoking weed since before I was born, I recently found out,  which probably contributed to this, which I can't help but think its her fault. This all just holds be back from being able to work at my full potential. I work at 1/2 of what I could, because of that shit.  I want to kill myself, finally. I've tried before.

Maybe I'm just being a pussy about it, but its borderline debilitating. I can hardly leave my room if anyone else is up, much less leave the house, and even when I do leave the house, I'm terrified of cars for some fucking reason. I mean, I know the reason, its shit that happened in my past, but its shit that I really didn't think made that much of an impact on me. Any time my dog barks or I hear anything remotely loud I panic and assume the people in my house are arguing about stuff. Then theres psychosis shit that's probably tied to the PTSD.

1325,"Exit Act - Suicide Reform  Hi, my name is Adam and I'm the founder of Exit Act ([exitact.org](https://exitact.org/)) -  A suicide reform initiative to legislate open euthanasia services for all acute and chronic intents and justifications. I'm a 36 year old Human Relations Specialist for Social Neglect, Chemistry Interaction and Gray Area Matters. My impetus is assimilation for empathetic, explicate and advisory purposes. If you find my development to be an unfortunate necessity I ask that you please share sentiments and contribute other helpful information through the appropriate forums on this service for our legislative use. If you've been impacted by suicide and support our mission to establish humane administration for suicidal persons consider making a financial contribution through our [crowdfund](https://exitact.org/crowdfunding) to support our efforts and help those that are unable to cover burial costs in the wake of suicide events. Referencing is highly instrumental if you know someone that was impacted by suicide and would also be interest in contributing to our mission. On February, 1, 2021  (National Freedom Day)  I will lead an open meeting for public expressions and opinions on the topic of 'open euthanasia legislation's in front of the white house in Washington, DC 20500 U.S.A. at 10:00 AM EST (1:00 PM PST). Ensuing campaign proposals for legislation will commence, thereafter, and stress the sentiments of contributing forum members and the information provided through our Instruments &amp; Provisions forum will be used to devise our legal documents. I thank you, sincerely, for your interest in Exit Act. &amp;#x200B; Kind Regards, Adam",1,suicide

The life is scarce and water ever more. A distant traveler, unfamiliar with these lands, leaving shortly forgotten footsteps in the ever changing landscape. As he walked, flowers began to sprout, finding life anew. Clouds from his lands follow behind as an omen of life. The rains began and life ran rampant. People never walked through these lands, he was the first, and yet instead of destroying what little there was, he created life from nothing. Deer followed, and then the birds, and then the decay to begin life over again. Sand turned to dirt, dirt began life, and life made room for death. The circle of life had been restored to these distant lands. The strangers journey was near it's end, as he walked through the mountains the petals of the new found life fade. The deer perish, leaving the life which was given for the short time. Then the dirt degraded and turned back to the uninhabitable earth as it had began. Life drained from the desert, leaving it as barren as it had started. The earth continued it's breathes as if this brief moment had not interrupted the barrenness.",0,suicide

I'm extremely bad at math and of course I don't know how to use a compass thanks to my stupid motor skills. Let's talk about my free time. I play video games in my free time and one of the reasons why I play video games is because I want to distract myself from the fact that I'm autistic but I can't really keep a conversation going when I'm talking to people online because I just don't know what to say. And I suck at video games too. Yep I suck at my hobby. I play Minecraft and I suck at PvP(Player vs player)  even though I've been doing it for over 5 years. I just can't do it well.

1390,"Having suicidal thoughts after 4 months of medical issues resulting in rosacea. Is there some type of place I can go to get better?Hey, Like it says, I have been having really dark thoughts lately. I'm out of work on an FMLA. After 4 grueling months of tons of medical issues following a weird reaction to a medication, doctors contradicting each other, being told it's all in my head/anxiety, I've become incredibly depressed and drained. There still is no definite diagnosis but I definitely seem to have some sort of complicated rosacea that is incredibly painful/easily flared at the moment.  I know I can't do this on my own. My panic attacks and depression are making my health issues worse and worse. My worsening medical issue is making my anxiety/depression worse. I'm unable to drive (can't wear my glasses or contacts due to the pain) and too sick to go to work as any stress sets it off again, getting worse with each flare. If I go outside (I live in Florida) the heat or sunlight set it off  At night, I can't sleep. I have stopped eating as the Prozac makes me feel ill. Now I am on doxycycline as well that messes with my stomach. I am afraid to go outside, eat, or even cry. It's obviously affecting relationships in my life as well  Is there a medical facility/wellness type center to check into where doctors can help my mental and medical issues?

1391,"Reddit, I need out of this house. If I can't get out, then I don't want to wait 2 years in hell. Well, here goes. I'm 16. I guess i'll start from childhood.. My mom was an alcoholic. Drunk on the floor all day and night - unless she was currently drinking.  My brother molested me nearly every night until I was 12. I told my mom and she yelled at me - for ""calling out your brother like that"" So, that was that. I still have to live with him. He's disgusting. He's mentally and physically handicapped and doesn't shower or change his clothes on his own. I hate being around him but I have no choice. There's 4 people living in this 2 bedroom house. I sleep on a couch. It's  killed my back. I never had my own room or even a place to put my clothes. But the main reason I need out is my mother. She has lost it. She's verbally and at times physically abusive, constantly. She doesn't want me alive and quite honestly the only reason I don't think she'll kill me is because she's physically unable to. She's always yelling. Always. At me, at my 75 year old grandmother. She calls me a stupid bitch. A dumbass. A worthless piece of shit. Stupid. Worthless. It just rings through my head all the time. Now, because I made two F's this semester, she's taking me out of my school and putting me in an alternative school. She won't let me see my boyfriend of two years. She's drug testing me. She comes out to the living room (where I sleep) in the middle of the night to scream at me more. I'm done with it. I need out. I need her either getting help or in jail and  something done with my brother, and quickly. I don't know where to start, though. If this isn't fixed soon, i'm done. I can't do it. I'm going out with my boyfriend tonight and I had to fight like hell with my mother to be able to.. because it's kind of like a ""goodbye"" thing.

Is there anything I can do to fix my life?I'm 27 and trapped in a shitty job in a shitty city, partly due to my family and partly due to the fact that I was unable to pass job interviews while I was unemployed. My dad is manipulative and got me a car seemingly so he could use it as leverage on me. If I'm not doing what he wants, he just reminds me he's sacrificing everything to make payments on the car for me. I was going to just give it back, but the transmission broke while I was going to a job interview out of state, and I was on the hook for the entire cost since he didn't want to pay for it. He is very emotionally invested in the job he got me since he has friends there. I need to give 110% while he constantly polices me or he's going to look bad. My problem is always going to be earning enough acceptance from other people to make money. I can live with being alone and single forever, but I can't live with doing a shitty job on top of that. I'd rather just kill myself than be stuck doing something horrible just to perpetuate a meaningless existence. I've just taken off in the past on long road trips. If I do that now, I can expect to have the police called on me for something.

The fundamental reality is that I'll NEVER be satisfied. Happiness will forever be a carrot on a stick I'll willingly chase till meaningless death.

I don't do H, and I've decided long ago that above all, I'm a responsible drug user. I haven't faltered, I've never let cannabis, alcohol, or tobacco interrupt my life.

I do like my new public therapist and my psychiatrist even tho he's not perfect. He prescribed me latuda without telling me I need to take it with almost 300 calories.

And in the back of my mind, I know it's the mania talking, but I just don't care. I'm loud and giggly and obnoxious and I've done stupid things like start huge projects and send nudes to strangers. And when I crash, all this comes back to bite me in the ass. Everything I do is half finished. The conversations I initiated when I was manic just stop, because without the mania I cannot handle them. I get so self conscious and paranoid. I'm always tired and I can't do anything without wondering what everyone thinks of me, whether or not they're watching, etc. But everyone is acquainted with the happy version of me, the friendly, confident, outgoing version. So I force myself to talk to people, to interact, and it's torture. The amount of anxiety I get everyday makes me loathe even waking up. Every time I end a conversation, the only thing I can think is, 'wow, i really should kill myself.' And the logical solution would be to tell someone, right? Let people know? But nobody would take me seriously. I'm that kid, the one that's friends with everybody, the class clown, whatever. I don't have any close friends. I'm basically public domain, and the moment I say anything about wanting to off myself, they're turned away. It's over. They come to me for answers on tests and to laugh and gossip; they couldn't give two fucks about my personal life. Can't tell my parents because they wouldn't take me seriously either. I start on varsity basketball, I play two instruments in the top band, and I make straight A's. I have a roof over my head and clothes on my back. They would see no logical reason for me to be suicidal. I hide everything from them. I self harm in such a way that it looks like a scrape or a welt I got in basketball.

Im still not over being in an abusive relationship 2+ years ago. And my most recent ex didn't take me seriously because I was in an abusive relationship, so that opened old wounds.

In 2013, my life took a turn for the better when I entered Gymnasium(the German version of High School). I actaully started to have a normal social life, went out with friends, and enjoying going to school.  Now I'm in Uni and the old thoughts I buried deep down in my mind are beginning to resurface. And even so I'm studying together with lots of people for about half a year I wasn't able to make a single contact.  Having no one to talk to is fucking mind-numbing. I can assure you. But due to my low self-esteem, I am just too afraid to speak to people. Back in High School, people approached me, so it was easy. But it seems like an impossible task now. The fear is getting so bad, that I'm even too afraid to look at my emails. Going outside is getting more and more uncomftable. It appaears that my anxiety is getting worse by the day. It sucks.  And the worst thing is that I have no one, absolutetely fucking no one, not even my parents(which are more interested in themselves than anything else) I can rely on, someone to talk about my issues.

I am so scared right now I can't handle it. Tuesday, the probation officer wants to look everything over, Wednesday the judge gives his ruling on whether I qualify for early release.

1555,"Fairly certain suicide is how I will die.I'm generally happy, but I still want to kill myself.  I guess I do have a lot of worries about my future. I have a pretty good social life, and a great girlfriend, but soon I will have to go to college and start all over and leave all of those people behind. I'm so attached to them I honestly don't know how I'm going to handle saying goodbye.  I wish that I could just die now. I see no reason to keep living. I don't think I have a bad life ahead of me, or currently. I just don't want to be alive.  My mom recently told me that if anything fatal happened to me, her life would be over. So I guess I'll have to wait a very long time until my parents are dead. So as of now, my plan is to kill myself once they die. Hopefully I will distance myself far enough from anyone else at that point so nobody misses me.  Or maybe by then I'll change my mind. Who knows. But as of now, I am quite certain that I will die by suicide.",1,suicide
1556,"I can't deal with losing my best friend, losing two of my other ""friends"", and school and homeworkI have known my best friend for two years, let's call her Andrea. This year, I met some of her other friends and joined her friend group. I already knew two people. Andrea and one of my friends, ""Crystal"". I joined the group and met everyone and everything was going well. Then, I came to terms with one of my long lost friends and we became friends again. Let's call him Floyd. We talked in person and on Instagram. One day, he found out about a really bad embarrassing thing I did. I thought we were friends again, but he blackmailed me. He forced me to tell Andrea and she was ok with it and understood. Then he said that wasn't enough and I had to tell all my friends in the friend group. I told my part of the story to some of them and then Floyd told them and blew it way out of proportion. He also teamed up with Crystal, who I thought I was friends with, to tell them what I ""did to him"" and how ""toxic"" I am. Turns out, we were friends before but she got mad at me because I'm ""toxic"" and never told me. She was acting all nice around me and didn't even tell me that she's mad. They talked about me, blackmailed me, and then told my best friend bullshit. I texted Andrea and she said that she's not going to be involved with me because I'm causing drama. I begged her to let me explain and she blocked me. I have talked her out of suicide several times and she's scared of me now because of the bullshit Floyd and Crystal told her. I haven't talked to her in a few weeks, but I'm still freaked out about this whole thing. I made new friends, but I still miss her. And I can't stop wondering if my friends actually like me because of what happened with Crystal. I'm so stressed about school too. I'm in all AP classes and I have so much homework. I also have band practice for three hours after school almost every day and it's so hard to get everything done. I even have tons of homework on the weekend.

1559,"I feel like I'll be your ex girlfriendTwo months ago, the man of my dreams broke up with me over a misunderstanding. I tried to save the relationship by going over to this house which was 2hrs away by train when he said it was over via text. Only to hear him to me that I need to leave his house and that being together was never going to happen and that by me going over just confirmed his decision. I cried like crazy. I felt so depressed. I became afraid that he didn't even care about me. The next train would come at 6am and it was 1am. All I could think about is how would I survive without my best friend and my soul mate. I don't have a strong relationship with my family who lives on the other side of the country. My friends live far from NYC. I just felt instantly alone. And shocked. I told him I wouldn't leave his house unless he called the police. Which was crazy to say. But for some reason I really didn't think he wanted me out after having a good talk about our future a few days before. So I yelled and said if he really wanted me gone I'll disappear forever and I ran upstairs to the kitchen as he chased me down. I wanted to grab a knife and stab myself in the stomach but I didn't even get that far to grab onto anything. I ran downstairs and tried to take some medicine but he took it away. He called his roommate downstairs and they called the police on me. I cried on the floor as he pinned me down and said ""so what? Now ur gonna say that I hit you?"" And I was shocked that he would use my past to make me feel something bad. The police suggested I go into the hospital a block away. I knew I wasn't okay so I did. I spent three days in a ward. Thinking how stupid this all was. But I can't forget how he didn't bother to support me through all of this. Two weeks later I had a miscarriage. I tried to contact me but he wanted nothing to do with me. He said I had friends to help me with a tough time but that we need to stop communicating. And since that day I really feel lost.

I'm pretty sure it's because school has started and it's horrible and I cried so hard I almost threw up because of the work.

He keeps leaving me on read after I opened up to him about some stuff and we had sex and I'm way too attached for him but whatever this isn't about him. With all of that on my mind, I've been so much closer to self-harming and I've been thinking about ways to kill myself. I know you're probably reading this and thinking, 'jeez she needs therapy' but that's the thing, neither my mom nor dad has enough money to put me in therapy. I could do it myself, but I only have enough money for like one session, which I don't think would even help. And even if I was in therapy, I wouldn't be able to tell my therapist about my self-harm or suicidal thoughts because no one knows about it. And I've been doing that since I was 13. I haven't told any mental health experts about it. Not even my psychiatrist or normal doctor. And I'm too scared to tell them about it because I know they'll have to tell my parents and then my mom will become all emotional and protective over me and I really really really do not want that.

I moved away from my life when I turned 11, moving to Florida from my hometown in Rhode Island. And I've been alone for the past 5 years. Its miserable. I wake up every day to the same thing, and have been for five years. Even summer is lonely. Nobody is there for me. There's nowhere to go here either without a car. At first I could do this, but now I just can't... This can't be my life. I want to end it all. ""I think I'm going to take the last 30 acetaminophen pills I have left and see what happens."" That's what I tell myself whenever I'm ready to end it all, but something keeps me from doing it. I guess I don't want to make my mother grieve, I'm one of her only reasons to be happy. At least I think so, that's how mothers feel about their children, and my brother was a major fuckup so now I'm trying to be somewhat normal, but I'm too broken now for it to even convincing. It's obvious I'm miserable. Depressed. Angry. Hopeless. Everything I can think of, and I'm it. I don't know how I can keep functioning on a day to day basis, and its obvious my mom is probably getting fed up with me being miserable all the damn time. How dare I stop caring. Jesus, I feel stupid for posting this, like I should end it all since people obviously can't help me. At this point, I don't think anything can help me.",1,suicide

What I mean is that there are people worse off than me and yet they still manage to be happy. I can't, I've tried to like myself but I can never think of any reasons why I should. I just feel absolutely inferior to everybody I come into contact with, it's maddening! All I do is think about how pathetic I am and how much better everyone else is.  If I'm not thinking about that I'm fantasising about my ideal self. But with that comes the realisation that my ideal self is a physical impossibility (just realised how that sounds... I'm not like a furry or otherkin freak no offence to those people, I mean in terms of height, weight, attractiveness etc.) Why was I born? It just seems like a cruel joke. I am a joke.

I havent made any impact. It's pointless to stick around. It's 99.99% confirmed that I'll never be happy, as the poverty cycle shows no mercy to anyone. The 0.1% is in case some rich foreigner stumbles upon me, decides they actually don't find me annoying or ugly or stupid or useless, and decides to get me out of this fucking boring ass country. lmfao.

So everyday I have to try my best, search for guidances on the internets, and it's extremely hard to understand these things. Only half-way until my final draft and just realized i actually didnt progress anything at all. My whole time amount invested just turned out to be a huge waste. Its extremely stressful just thinking about it..It's really hopeless..  And now it is accompanied with the so called ""family issue"", i had some family arguments and my mom said that she wished she had never given birth to me ( my parents divorced )... I've been asking for help from some friends, acknowledging that they have their problems too, and they tried to act like they were giving a hand, but behind my back they actually didnt give a shit. They left me out in any discussion, and i just discovered it, it was not a surprise but it did disgust me a bit, since i hoped they really helped and i enjoyed the moment we discuss our dissertations together. Now, I have mental breakdown, like more than five times on a daily basis or so, whenever i try to continue doing my dissertation.

I'm starting my sophomore year in high school and I used to have a clue as to what I want to be in life, but I'm starting now to realize that it is impossible for me. My step father pushes me to be the best version of my self but I just don't want to continue. I get good grades in school and I excel in sports, but every single time it's never enough for him. I'm afraid of going downstairs for the reason of being yelled at every single time.  He'll always figure something out to just lash out at me, and I can't take it anymore. I really want to leave and just not have to deal with him. Everything I do is always below his expectations for me and I always get yelled at because of it. I do everything by the book and how he wants me to do it but he finds a way to insult me and say that it's pathetic. When I try to explain that I feel bad that day or sick, he shrugs it off and says that it's pointless and that since I am a child I should not feel tired or bored.  I know this sounds pathetic because this issue is not as serious as everyone else's, but I have had these thoughts for a couple of years now, because of him. I've researched how to buy cyanide pills, and all I have to do is earn some money to buy them. It's pathetic though, I am on a foundation for success yet I don't feel any of it. I'm constantly reminded that when I feel satisfied, that it's worthless and amounts to nothing, and that I have to do even more. I just get so so tired of doing more all the time.

Let me introduce myself first, i'm a 15 year old guy with no life. I've been struggling with depression for a while now and recently i started having a lot of panic attacks. School is going really shit right now. Don't really have any friends anymore except a few from school since my parents won't allow me to go outside anymore. The reason i can't go outside is because i used to do drugs, nothing hard just some weed and sometimes a drink. I didn't even do it because i liked it, i just wanted to be with my friends. Ever since i lost the privilege to talk to them my life has been going to shit (sorry for the language but it's true). I don't get any enjoyment out of anything so the only thing i'll be doing is either studying, sleeping or eating. Tried to do some new things but i just can't find a reason to do something. I'm studying a lot so i can go to a university and get out of here so i can finally get my freedom back. But due to recent events i'll probably have to redo my year. I can't handle that. I'll lose the only friends i'll have and i probably won't be able to make new ones because of my social anxiety and autism. I'm just so tired and i've really been thinking about killing myself.

My biggest insecurity has to do with romance, its like I need to be liked or loved by someone whom I think is beyond my reach, because if that person shows interest, my ego spikes up.

There are two main varieties: a purple-fruited type, P. edulis f. edulis, and the yellow-fruited P. edulis f. flavicarpa.[3][4] Usually the vine produces a single flower 5–7.5 cm wide at each node.[1][5] The flower has 5 oblong, green sepals and 5 white petals.[6] The sepals and petals are 4-6mm in length and form a fringe.[6] The base of the flower is a rich purple with 5 stamens, an ovary, and a branched style.[1] The styles bend backward and the anthers, which are located on top of the styles, have a very distinct head.[6] The fruit produced is entirely fleshy (making it botanically a berry), and is spherical to ovoid.[3] The outside color of the berry ranges from dark-purple with fine white specks to light yellow.[1] The fruit is 4—7.5 cm in diameter; purple fruits are smaller, weighing around 35 grams, while yellow fruits are closer to 80 grams.[3] The smooth, leathery rind is 9–13 mm thick, including a thick layer of pith.[1][3] Within the berry, there are typically 250 black seeds, each 2.4 mm in length.[6] Each seed is surrounded by a membranous sac filled with pulpy juice.[1] The flavor of the juice is slightly acidic and musky.[1] The passion fruit's flavor can be compared to the guava fruit.[1]",0,suicide

I went through deep depression from 12years onwards, struggling with variations of self harm; cutting, burning, I even developed trichotillomania, anxiety disorder and alot of trust issues. Fast forward with all this crap to 17 years old, where I met a guy off the internet and ran away to be with him. Fast forward another two months and he began physically abusing me. I let it slide too many times to count. After a while, I ran away to another guy I met off the internet. He was nice, but he was too far into the churchy side of things and I was told I had demons in me, so I ran back to the abusive guy. Fast forward with the same abuse and we buy a house together in 2010. Things are still bad, and I kept making stupid mistakes. I tried to reach out to my brothers friend, and he ended up text messaging me one day after my boyfriend hit me, saying he'd 'kill him', boyfriend found out and kicked me out of the house. I had nowhere to go but back to my dads, where that abuse started back up. I ended up getting with a guy from my work 3 months later, and he was lovely. Old boyfriend found out, said sorry and that he'd change, so I was stupid enough to go back. Fast forward one and a half years, and I'm sitting on his parents couch, still in the abusive relationship, with no friends (because he made me get rid of them), still with same depression, still trying to self harm and stuck in a job I don't want but I have to stay at because he quit his job.

Usually I just tough it out, bury myself in work, try to avoid self-reflection by filling the time with other things, etc. But I'm finishing my first semester of college and I feel like I've really hit a wall. It started off really well. I felt like I had made a lot of friends fairly quickly, I got into some fairly exclusive student groups and I overall felt like I finally found the kind of meaning to life that I lacked in high school. For the first time I even had someone of the opposite sex express interest in me. Over the course of this semester though, it just seems to have fallen apart. I went through several different groups of friends, and every time it feels like it's ended disastrously. I'm no longer on speaking terms with virtually any of the friends I had when I got here. I feel like I'm beginning to falter in all my extracurricular commitments, forgetting lines in plays, messing up in performances, and I feel how much of burden I am on my peers. I've known for several years that I'm not the best at making friends, and keeping those friendships going. But I'm beginning to notice even more how unnecessary and even detrimental I am to the lives of the people I'm around.  I recently had an argument with a friend, and we are no longer on speaking terms. What makes it worse is that all of our mutual friends have taken her side. What's worse is that I don't know if they're justified or not. I felt like I had been in the right at the time, but ultimately it just feels like another instance in a long cycle of failed friendships. Since then, it's only felt worse. All of my friendships feel like their entirely dependent on partying. The only time I feel wanted now is when I'm wasted, and last night I didn't even feel that. I just feel like I'm completely forgettable. I don't have any strong friendships, and ultimately I will be forgotten my everyone here.  Ultimately, I'm probably the most successful I've ever been.

And I do it alone.  I went to my doctor's appointments and mental health hospitals alone too. I am in a much better place but i did it all by myself. Ngl, comments and messages here on reddit have made me less alone than everything else in my life. I guess what I'm trying to say is that life isn't a movie. No secret best friend will come and help you. If you are drowning in your own depressive mess, no one is really going to reach out to make sure you're ok and can stay ok. Heck, even your doctor and therapist don't really care. No one will even give you a hug. I'm not suicidal anymore but I'm posting this to say that I did it all by myself. I was alone and I am still alone but s*it even I barely give a crap. I'm the one who exhausted every resource trying to get better. No one stayed with me to make sure I didn't cut my wrists. I had to use duck tapes and arm bands. No one helped me with my panic attacks...i just had to hold ice in my shower. And I even learned to meditate b/c talking to myself was the only way to get through it. I will probably relapse and I will probably feel suicidal again.

For me though, this is true, and I wanted to get it off my chest.  What a weird feeling, to wish I was suicidal. Each day is literally torturous and I am so beyond dissociated that I no longer have any tools to deal with any of this. It is just pure torture, neverending, much in the way that I'm sure that many of guys have, but also quite different. My dissociative disorder, at its basic root, doesn't touch my motivation/sadness. There are some papers that propose that I don't have anhedonia but rather an attentional mechanism (or lackthereof) that gives the illusion of adhendonia, and I can't agree more. Before this got to the point where I had literally 0 percent of my former self/emotions, I was actually never so motivated. Each day, every second, I had the greatest wish, to get better, as I could feel the part of me still in the right dimension. I was the opposite of depressed. But now that I can't actually feel any sense of normalcy, its like I'm stuck in this weird limbo. I can't kill myself, I don't feel suicidal, yet at the same time I for sure can't live like this much longer. Each day it gets rose, but I don't actually ever get more depressed.  I wish I was depressed and suicidal so I could just off myself, because I know for sure I am never going to get better. I guess I am going to put up a fight and try everything possible in terms of treatments and waiting it out, but I know I've lost the battle.  I dunno, life is just weird.",1,suicide

It has been a few years since I have had the opportunity to catch up with you, but today I did and you've changed… You aren't the game that I remembered but maybe that's a good thing. Looking back, you provided me space to explore areas of my imagination and curiosity that would otherwise never have been possible in the physical world. My parents thought that you were a pointless game and constantly tried to get me to explain my reason to play with you, but you were so meant so much to me that cannot be put into words; you weren't just a world of blocks but my world of blocks sculpted to my own pleasing. You provided me with an escape from my real-world troubles that bothered me. I would hurry home from school every afternoon looking forward to playing with you with my friends and a bag of cereal. You were apart of many memorable experiences that I had with my childhood friends that have either moved on to other friends or moved on to another life; sometimes the world is all that is left to prove such a friendship existed. I thank you for all the childhood memories that I could reflect back upon today and shed a tear - not of sadness or regret but of happiness.

None of them really know me and I have no intention of opening up. I feel pretty unmotivated about doing anything, schoolwork seems more like a waste of time than anything else these days. The only thing that truly keeps me from ending it all, when things get really bad and I'm laying in bed in a huge bout of depression (it is on and off, sometimes it gets to me hard) is willpower/insanity? There's always a voice in my head scolding me about being weak and selfish. How dare I allow the cruel thing that is life to defeat me? Am I so selfish as to not even consider the effect it would have an the people around me, even if I don't like them? It brings me right out of it for a while.

She almost got me murdered and raped by her dealers, but hey, no pity here it made me stronger. It taught me to fight. She didn't have the money for food, so I ate out of the trash (I was like 5-6). Soon, my dad found out she cheated on him and he left her. He remarried an abusive woman and I was constantly abused for two years. Tied up, duct taped, beaten, pinched, bitten, thrown down hallways, sprayed with bleach... etc. That's all good, she's going to deal with consequences... Sure she gave me trauma and trust issues, but I am also stronger and more cautious. I even talked to the school in first grade and they turned the other cheek. Soon, she also cheated on my dad and he left her... but only because she cheated. Whatever, I get it, every man for himself. I was then sent to my grandparents where I was safe, for a while. Soon there was a personal incident, but that's okay too, he will deal with the mistakes he has made. Karma's a bitch, God asks questions, and is the only true judge that matters after all. I grew up with them, safe after the incident until about five or six years ago when my dad remarried a somewhat sane woman. She is okay, but she is immature. She needs to find blame everywhere. She is petty, but that's another problem that does not belong to me. My dad is decent, even after everything he let me go through without talking about it a single time. Maybe he will answer for that too. They have taken everything they could from me. The one sport I was using to cope. My freedom. My childhood. My innocence. My emotional and mental stability. My trust. However, I'm somewhat grateful. These things affect me, but in the least. I have straight A's. I have great friends.

Then we were offered a can of ""soft drink"" *coughs in beer*, i said no but she said yes and we shared it which i wasn't expecting, by now it was like 130 and everyone had gone too bed but we were still in the chair around the fire, we just talked then she fell asleep and i couldn't move cos it was one of the nice stuff feelings ever, i eventually fell asleep and sometime during the night it got really cold and we ended up with a blanket over us idk who put it over us, we woke up i took her too go get coffee cos they had a mobile coffee shop and we held hands on the way, then the next day we had too say our goodbyes and it was like nothing happened between us, which at the time i thought nothing of but now like damn, now at school its just a nod too each other and occasionally saying hi, it was one of the nicest experiences of my life and its sad that theres nothing between us cos i still like her a-lot, well im going camping in the holidays with the same people most likely so i hope something comes of it.... if you read this thanks, just hit me today and it hit hard and i really miss her, thanks again people",0,suicide

I also bottle up all the things about them that hurt me and drink to feel better, then eventually tell them off. My brother beat my face for a solid 3 minutes, twice within 15 minutes, for saying shot that was true but he didn't like.  That was the day before Thanksgiving 2017.  I spent the next three days in bed thinking of how I was going to kill myself.  Nobody checked on me. Now my mother and niece physically attacked me the other day, stole my phone and hid my car key.  I lost my job.  They think I'm making up what happens to me and the only thing really wrong with me is the drinking. My sister called the cops on me a few months ago for being suicidal and telling her off.  I got a felon with a gun charge.  They can give me 5 to 40 years in prison.  I'm not going back to fucking prison.  I've been before and can't stand being around convicts who actually belong there. And nobody ever apologized or feels any remorse for the things they do to me. So I was going to do it today but everyone was coming over tonight, I was trying to hurry but scared.  I heard a noise, looked out the window, and it was my mom coming home from church.

I was born in the wrong place in the wrong time, and If I had to decide my birth I would of rather not be born. Since I was little I've realized the privilege people have over me. Everyday for the past 17 years, I've woken up to the feat of someone coming up to my door and taking me and my family away from the life I've created and theirs. The burden of not being able to do things others can kills me inside. This weight keeps gnawing at me saying I can never be normal, and I wont. I go to school but I see no future, because I have none. I can't study and frankly I have no motivation. my only option so I can stay is marrying and having kids. I don't want to give anyone my problems. This brings me to ending my life, I can say I've been depressed over my situation and that a big reason why. I just dont see the point in living when I dont have a chance. Right now, I'm not going to do it maybe in a few years? I know my parents, friends will be but I can't hide for the rest of my life.

My only childhood memories are abuse, and my earliest thoughts were of suicide, before I knew suicide was a thing. As a four year old, the earliest I can remember, I remember crying after being punished by my father and pleading mentally with God - ""I want to be dead. I want to go away. Please."" I tried to kill myself for the first time at 10 years old. I held a gun to my head and pulled the trigger. Unfortunately, it wasn't a real gun. Just a hyperrealistic airsoft gun.  From then until now, I have attempted 5 times. Each have failed due to my own stupidity. I was hospitalized once. It didn't help me. No medication works. Therapy doesn't work. I have a plethora of mental illnesses and I cannot handle any of them. My biggest struggle is bipolar disorder, where I spend 11.5 months of the year in a heavy depression. It's because of this depression that I dropped out of high school. And since I was always pressured to be smart instead of work hard, I have no skills. No hobbies. No talent. No work ethic. No GED. No diploma. 12 years of school, I suffered through bullies and psychological trauma, and I have nothing to show.  My mom has cancer. I don't know how much longer she's going to last. My girlfriend lives miles away from me. I haven't seen her in over half a year. I don't find comfort in God. I don't see the glass half full. I don't see a glimmer of hope in the future. We all die in the end, one way or another. What is the point of suffering another 50+ years when I could end it now?  It's pretty clear I'll never be happy. I'll never feel like a normal person can. I'll never outgrow my PTSD. I'll never not second guess every move I make because of the crippling anxiety. I'll never do anything productive because I can barely will myself out of bed.

1896,"The focus on ""suicide prevention"" instead of the root issues shows that others truly only care about themselves.Society abhors suicide as most people in society become very sad when someone dies and they have to acknowledge it. Society does not care about depressed people who do not die, as it is easy for most people to ignore. Because of this, society chose to ban suicide and prevent it with extreme levels of force, condemning ""suicidal persons"" to a hospital where they cannot commit suicide and can be ignored by most people. Most people now do not have to care that many of these ""suicidal people"" suffer every day even with ""treatment,"" as no suicide occurs in them so they can ignore these people. Any ""caring"" about the depression these people face only extends so far as preventing suicide. This is why most suicide hotlines do not accept calls from people not in ""imminent danger"" and why mental hospitals do not accept people who are ""not a risk to themselves."" It always brings a smile to my face to know that I can and will kill myself when I choose. I'm alone very often now, nothing is fulfilling anymore, and I want to die. Many people here and in other places believe I should not be allowed to kill myself because I am lonely. Most of them won't take any steps to actually stop the loneliness, the ones that do end up ghosting me after a few days. Their beliefs about my actions are meaningless to me. I'm glad for once someone's feelings will have no bearing on what I do with my life. Fuck them, it's only my life and not theirs to regulate. Most of the people on reddit only care that suicide doesn't occur. That's why the people on this sub like to dox posters to call the cops and never follow up. It's never about the effects on the person, it's about *preventing suicide at all costs.* It's so fucking entitled when people squeal about how how bad it is for me to kill myself while never actually giving a shit about the underlying issues and telling me to just &gt;stop caring about being alone.",1,suicide

1900,"quick note about Super Straight This is coming from a trans person so hear me out. ""Super Straight"", the name is the key part to sounding offensive. Why? Because it implies that trans women are not women. That is the only reason. Making sexualities is a normal thing as you have seen from within the community. It's been a heated debate among trans people about whether genital preference is transphobic or not. I will say **No, it is not transphobic.** It is fine to not want to date someone with specific genitals.  * I would like to bring up the sexuality ""skiliosexual"". It is the attraction to genderqueer people. Mainly used by genderqueer people, it's not hateful towards non-genderqueer people it's just preference. With that preference is fine even us trans people have them. Most people don't have an issue with preference, it is 100% ok to not want to date a trans woman. As long as it's not about disliking trans people &amp; just about things like genital preference. The name super straight itself is fairly transphobic **but** if you identify that way due to genital preference then there is nothing wrong with it. As said before, if you aren't identifying that way to hate trans people then I don't see the issue. If anyone has a different view point on this, feel free state your thoughts.",0,suicide

Then he brought up how he wants to be friends with his ex whom I despise and he knows that. Long story short, I had an utterly horrible day and that completely ruined it. Yesterday I was just sad all day and nothing good happened at all. He was supposed to come over tonight but he's blowing me off to work on a guitar and he knows that upset me but whatever. So now I have nothing to look forward to for the rest of the day. Tomorrow we're supposed to hang out but who the hell knows about that, he'll probably forget then hang out with his friend. So I know this paragraph was about him but only because I needed that rant out. There's so much other shit going on and I guess that just tops it off. Honestly, I have no friends. I've pushed my only two friends away to focus on my boyfriend because he makes me the happiest and that's what I thought I needed but he doesn't do the same. So now, I'm just utterly alone. No internet friends, no online friends. It just fucking sucks. I found this guy in school that I'd like to be friends with but I'm way too shy to talk to him.

In reality I have likely been dealing with it my entire life. Depression, anxiety and PTSD now as an adult due to multiple traumas in my life including molestation by a family member over the course of several years as a young child into my teen years. I've been on countless meds, been in counseling, been to the hospital, done heavy counseling from that for over a month and still I continue to find darkness and despair in my life. I've been married twice and my second marriage is failing. I struggle over our lack of a sex life as she has zero sex drive which also causes issues for my mental stability likely due to the sexual abuse.

All I seem to end up is a burden, people try to express how many options I have, but whatever I do ends in disappointment. I feel like I've heard it over and over again, eat better, exercise more, take your medication, go to therapy, practice meditation, mindfulness, learn about CBT techniques, see your doctor, engage in social activities, find some hobbies, be human.

I was super scared and worried, I had nobody to talk to and no way to check of I actually was pregnant. While I was wondering if I was pregnant, I had come to a conclusion I thought I would never have the balls to come to... ""I'll kill myself."" I have a silent death wish, but this was a serious, no fear statement. I was going to kill myself if I was pregnant. I wasn't scared at all, because I had no other way out, it HAD to be done...... Maybe it was shock, but I felt kinda good... Like, being able to just know if I ever fuck up my life so bad I can't go back I can comfortably just kill myself. I don't know how I'd do it, but that was never something I thought about.  It's helped me get over my suicidal thoughts as whenever one pops into my head, I just tell myself ""this isn't a life changing situation, you can't kill yourself"" and it puts me at ease.

1950,"A life you will never have. There is always that moment when there was a ray of sunshine. Things could have been different. I had a life that was actually worth living. For a single year I lived in a different state. My job was a dollar above minimum wage and in retail, but I fucking loved it. I FUCKING loved it. I was so far from all but two people in my family that I lived with, in a big city, and had the nicest coworkers i'll probably never have again. I was only on a low dose of effexor that I could have eventually gotten off. I was truly happy with life for the only time in my life. I was content with life. I had even lost half the weight I needed to lose. I started exercising, opening up to people and talking like a real human being, was functioning at a basic level.  But then it ended. Circumstances forced me to move back to my shit hole of a home state. Back to family that has caused me so much pain and misery. A place with no life, bleak depressing rust belt ""squalor"" . Now I am back to ekeeing out a miserable existance. I was on one medication there and have been on six or more since moving back. AND started abusing alcohol so much that I ""Nearly killed myself"" once according to my mother by vomiting in my sleep.  My job is in retail but at a worse place. Everyone in this city acts like the life has been sucked out of them. People are 75 percent less happy and kind. The jobs are shit and there is nothing around but cornfields and the dumbass conservative redneck inbred mouth breathers who tend them.  There will never be a happiness. Life is nothing but suffering for many people. I have not suffered like others who live in tragedy in the third world but everyone suffers in there own way. With no college education , way to pay for one, or way to afford to move out beyond this place, life will forever be meaningless. Death is the only answer. The sweet release of death.

We talked for 8 hours about everything, from basic life to my suicidal tendencies and she showed a lot of support. We saw each other again and I fell in love. We have a lot in common and she just won't leave my thoughts. But tonight she told me I won't become anything more than a friend and that she was sorry for giving wrong thoughts to me (broken english I know but I'm too drunk to try at this point).

My studies are not going anywhere anyway and most of the people I Care about seem to vanish at some point. This girl, we had so much in common, I rarely talk a lot as I'm shy but there I managed 8 hours without breaking a sweat and I did it again the day after. This is extremely unlikely for me.

Apparently she's been depressed for years and years and it's finally come to a head. Any advice would be awesome.. i don't want her to hurt herself and her family..

He acted like I didnt mean it.  It's not like go around telling people I'm suicidal.. this is serious to me.  Private.  Because I dont want people trying to stop me when I do.  He showed absolute no concern.  No worry.  Nothing.  He continued to tell me how angry he is at me for ruining our finances in the past which are still affecting us (even though I've changed my spending habits and am working hard and overtime and everything).  He says he has a right to be this angry and make me feel this bad for what I did in our past, even though I'm consistently doing everything to make up for it now.   I'm on my bathroom floor making plans to either hang myself or try to fight another day.  I cant do this anymore.  The daily fight in my head is more than I can handle anymore.

When I was a kid I was super sick, but no one ever believed me (""girl who cried wolf""). Diagnosed with lupus at 11. At 23, some of my family still doesn't believe me. It's been hard for me to work because of my treatments, I've been so sick lately. I just feel like a burden to everyone. I felt like a burden ever since I was 10, attempted my first at 12. I have done a lot of micro overdoses in my life to, I guess, get a taste for death and I'm sure I'm ready, and know exactly how much to take for a successful attempt.  I'm not just a burden because I'm sick, but I'm too much to deal with. So much so, I've nearly isolated myself and usually push people away because of past experiences where I've let others down. I've sought out help and treatment for years, nothing really has helped.

2029,"I'll never be a normal personAll my life, I've had a hard time relating to people. It's not that I was a loner, or didn't enjoy talking to them. The contrary - I consider myself extroverted. I enjoy talking to people. I even enjoy public speaking. I just can't make friends. It's not that I act in an off-putting way: I dress normally, shower, talk to people, and do all of these other things human beings are supposed to. People don't instantly reject me, I just don't form bonds to them with months of contact, while normal people do in hours. A while ago, I spoke to a psychiatrist about this, as well as depression. She thought it sounded like I have (high-functioning) autism. She conceded that this was unsolvable, but that I should strive to resolve things, since being unemployed is bad (and, also, won't pay her bills). Now, I know what the stock response to this is: autism is a part of your personality, if you cured it you wouldn't be you anymore, embrace the weirdness. But here's the thing: I don't want to be weird. I don't want to be a freak, I don't want to live in a group home, I want to be able to hold a drivers license without perjuring myself. All I've ever wanted in my life is to be a normal person. Imagine an accountant with 2.2 children in a stable, loving, monogamous, heterosexual marriage; that's the sort of life-style I'm going for. In light of what I've understood, it seems like I'll never be able to accomplish that. Normal human relationships will simply be forever off-limits for me. There'll always be the disclaimer, like the ballcap: ""Please be patient; I have autism"". Put bluntly, I'll always be the outsider.  It's commonly said that there's no cure for autism, but this is, in fact, not true. It's just a matter of what side-effects you're willing to put up with. In this case, sadly, it seems like anything is better than the status quo.",1,suicide

There are too many factors, don't think failing can say anything for certain. But I don't like NNN and others should know it: Ok, please take a break from Reddit, this stuff isn't gonna stop.

Went to the psychiatrist but shortly after overdosed on pills. I wish I died I got scared because my heart started beating really fast. I'm scared to go back because I don't want to talk about it and what if she knows about it? I only talked to her once she was really nice.

2074,"I feel the abyss closing inI failed college one semester a few years ago and took some time off, sporadically taking classes in the summer time while working and living with my folks.  I went back full time this past semester as a senior and failed again, because I am stuck in a major I hate and am too far along to switch/not mature enough to tough it out.  I've been notified by the school that I cannot attend for 2 years because of my performance, and my housing has dropped me since I no longer am enrolled.  My girlfriend, who I've been together with for over 4 years, is the one thing I care most about and the main reason I can feel afloat sometimes, but she has her own issues and is going back to her home country in the next few weeks for an unforeseeable amount of time.  I've burned up my parent's trust, and I don't blame them - I'm 24 with no degree and no prospects, and I can't keep living at home with them.  I'm about to be homeless and the fact that my girlfriend is going back to her country and won't be coming back to finish college here in the states any time soon makes me feel like giving up completely on love and life. I have no money, and I've burned through bridges with old friends and don't want to hold my hand out to them, and even if I did have money and friends, I have no will to keep struggling through life on my current path because I am uninspired and keep hitting roadblocks.  I feel like I wasn't made for this world, that I am not comprised of the same ""stuff"" that keeps other people chugging along through the mundane aspects of day to day life.  I want to off myself, but I just worry about breaking my girlfriend and my parents.  My girlfriend has had some suicidal thoughts of her own recently, and I don't want to push her over the edge.

2075,"What a great week it's beenI don't even know where to start. I just need to write this all down because god knows I can't tell anyone. First of all the New Zealand mental health system is a complete and utter piece of fucking shit. I mean, I knew that already but even the non-severe help sources are useless. I've been on this medication for two years, I tell them it doesn't work /that/ well and they finally listen, so now I've been dropped off it. Fun thing is, They thought it was a good idea to drop my medication entirely then schedule no appointments until a date that's almost a month and a half away. Way to make me safe. My room mate doesn't help, she's obnoxious and last night it clicked that I wasn't good, and now she's being far too sympathetic (while still obnoxious, no idea how that's working out) and asking me if I'm okay every five minutes. Work is frustrating me to no end and I've been removed from every task that used to give me pleasure, now I'm just stuck talking to the most pretentious and sheltered woman all morning while doing food prep with her. My best friend has always been there for me but she's going through some really, really bad shit at the moment and I don't want to bother her at all. I sleep past my alarm for work because my roommate and friends decide to do very late nights that keep me awake, then I'm mocked mercilessly at work for being a sleepy teenager who needs to man up. My self harm is getting pretty bad again, really deep- although it's hard to do when you have a roommate who skips all of her classes and is always at home with you. So when it happens, it happens en masse. I honestly don't know what to do. I've been in hospital before and my parents are fucking twats so if I do this, it needs to be successful. And I want it so, so badly. But I can't fail. Then again, knowing me, I'll fail at this too. ",1,suicide
2076,"Feeling so lonelyI'm halfway through college and I'm already miserable. I never had deep friends during HS either but we at least hung out during before school and during lunch. But now at college I have absolutely no one, and most days I just go to classes and come back to my dorm, eating lunch/dinner by myself. I met a bunch of people and know their names and all, but that's about it. I feel that there's no one who actually wants to see me and cares for me; that is, someone who actually takes time out of their day to hang out with me or chat with me out of their own accord. Who would actually feel some sense of loss if I were to just die. Sure I could probably message one of said guys above and chat about stuff (which is in fact pretty much all my social interaction is these days, but it's never the other way around. They never send me a message asking me about my day or anything. It feels like they're just responding back to my messages out of some obligation and then going on with their lies.) And I know someone's going to post a comment with the generic ""everyone cares"" or ""I care"" but that's clearly not true. &lt;rant&gt; How could someone on reddit care for a person they've never met and never will meet. If I hadn't made this post and just necked myself, there's no way you would have known. &lt;/rant&gt; So if I have no one who genuinely cares about me then I feel the need to live diminishes significantly. And I do feel it is indeed kind of selfish to want validation, but at the same time what I want isn't superficial validation but a friend that genuinely cares enough to want to take time out of their day to chat with me. Maybe the problem is on my end -- that I don't inspire anyone to do that, in which all the better that I die. ",1,suicide

I haven't been able to get a stable job in a year and a half, I stopped paying my credit card debt so I could continue making car and insurance payments so my debt has reached an untenable amount, and my gf has terminal cancer with likely less than a year left to live. I don't have money to go out with friends and even then I don't like seeing friends/acquaintances/family members because I feel like an abject failure and a disappointment, so many of my relationships have kind of just dissolved. I can't help support my gf financially much anymore either, already sank most of my money into it to no avail. I've spent more and more time thinking of surefire ways to end myself so I can stop being a financial burden on my parents, and I guess to just escape it all. I tell myself I wouldn't do it until after my gf dies as she's the main source of light in my life. I was able to tread water for a bit, but it's getting harder and harder. Apparently not having a job for 1+ years is a valid reason for not being able to get a job at all.  Showers have become a weird experience as well.

I didn't realize how much what he did to me stuck with me. He's abused me my whole life, mentally, physically, he pushed me so hard he broke my back. But lately the sexual abuse has been destroying me. When I see depictions of characters I love in media being used, hurt, or exploited, it sends me into a state of such deep sadness and the panic is overwhelming. Right now I just want to hang myself again. I have a rope on my ceiling that's been there for awhile. I want to do it, I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm such a broken waste of space. I can't handle anything anymore. I think the world would be so much better off if I were gone, and I would like to stop feeling this pain. when people tell you when you're little that it'll get better, I think that's a lie. It can get better, but for some people, their dreams, like mine will never come true.

I've been single for over a year and after my last breakup my mom has been mean and unwilling to help me emotionally or mentally and has berated me for leaving the relationship. I had been dating this woman since I started having my seizures so about 4 or so years. Women problems have always been a thing for me. I guess I don't pick well.

Im scared, and I am afraid of dying and going to hell, but I can't live like this anymore. I have constant feelings of impulsivity and wanting to hurt myself- suicidal ideation- in very specific ways. I obsess over them, and I worry I will lose my self control soon. I have fantasized about running away, but I can't do that. I have to get out of where I currently am. The other day, I told my psychiatrist how depressed I am, and she doesn't understand me. She recommended I get a light box. I almost ran out of the office both laughing and crying, because I felt so misunderstood and ignored. I have been hospitalized several times. I went through a partial hospital program a few months ago, and I vowed to get better. But I'm not. I'm worse. I am not going back there. I wanted to become a police officer or federal agent, but I can't now because of my psychiatric history. I took a break from university because I had the breakdown, and thought about returning and working in computers/IT after school. I can't go back. My brain is shot, my creativity is dead, and thinking of school makes me anxious. I work a minimum wage retail job, and I get bullied constantly every day. I hate it. I used to wonder why people committed suicide. Now I know. I've accepted the thought that one day, I will end up killing myself. The only reason why I'm still here is because my dad (and sometimes my mom) have saved me and talked me down and telling me things will get better and that they would be so sad if I died.

2142,"chronic pain - want to end itI'm 22 years old, and after injuring one of my hip muscles 3 years a go whilst cycling, things got progressively worse since then. which has led to many more problems that have cropped up because it wasn't diagnosed and fixed soon enough. 2 months a go I had hip surgery on both of my hips where they cut the tendons from my bones on my hip flexors. Before the surgery I couldn't walk normally, now I can walk without people staring at me, but I am in a lot of pain. Unfortunately I had an unneccasery surgery before this one which has left me unable to lift anything without very bad pain in my abdomen, which is making independent living a bit hard. I won't go into detail about my injuries and surgery. The long and the short of it is I've been in 24/7 pain for almost 3 years, I've had to drop out of college, move back in with my parents, lost friends, lost all physical hobbies. I can tell my parents are getting fed up, and I am getting fed up explaining how much pain I'm in if I can't do something. Every day I want to just walk out and be independent, but then I think..shit..I can't because I can't walk more than 100metres , and I can't even lift up a full milk bottle without pain that stops me. Being in pain for so long and being in pain still has really taken a toll on my mind. I'm generally a very level-headed person, and have never had any problems mentally. However I am now thinking about suicide every day, because the thought of living on for many more years in this pain, and not being able to do the one thing that really makes my soul sing..exercise and sport.

Its my sisters shes fifteen and lets say whats currently happening to her is a direct result of our home environment. Shes been sad for the past year, partly because she doesnt have many friends at school and partly because of our emotionally and verbally abusive parents. Recently its been getting worse, what shes having i think can only be described as a major depressive episode because its never happened like this before. At least 4 weeks ago she kept crying, had no motivation to do anything, she just constantly kept crying and i just comforted her. It lasted for a couple of days and then i thought she was better. But yesterday i found out shes been having this same depressive episode for the past couple of days, this time she cut herself with scissors all over her arm. I talked to her about this last night and she promised me she'd never do it again, so i check again in the morning and theres more fresh cuts. Someone please help I don't know what to do i'm in no position to tell my parents because they'd never understand. ",1,suicide

I found out this morning, that my wife has been planning to leave for the last 6 months, and is now just probably just waiting for after Christmas. Which probably isn't even happening this year, it's been so rough financially that we've barely kept our bills paid, never mind buying gifts. Recently lost work again because of covid restrictions. So finances are even worse, no idea how I'll make it in the new year. I have 300/1600$ for what I need for the end of the month no idea what to do for the rest.  Because we barely cover everything together, when she leaves I will lose everything, I've already lost my job, and my wife has been emotionally gone, when she leaves she wants to take our baby to her parents where I will almost never be able to see her (because of the distance), because she has family support and has been the primary guardian while I've worked full time. I don't have any family left, and have lost all my friends over the course of this relationship. Then I'm going to lose my house because I won't be able to keep up with rent/ bills. I've lost and am going to continue to lose everything. Including my hope, hope that things would get better.. hope for a future for myself. now when I think about the future, I see nothing for me.

They don't understand the mental anguish I go through when I actually slow down on the weekends and my mind begins to wonder to thoughts that are typically repressed to survive. I have this constant ""ache"" in my soul. It's the best way I can describe it. It is like the feeling of suppressing something huge and if I were to ever pull the plug on whatever is behind that ache, I would die of utter despair that would stop my heart, cold. People don't understand what it's like to never want to hurt anyone, and yet, you are the one who always gets hurt by people. You feel worthless. Ugly. Unsuccessful. Bitter. Unhappy. And yet, I am pretty successful for a 23 year old in modern society. I have my own place, have a nice job out of college, and live somewhat comfortably, though this month I'm struggling. I have friends who still live at home and can't even be independent, who are happier than me. But, then again, they don't have a clue what I experience and the ache that follows me around because they weren't brought up in an abusive home that stole their childhood and teenage years, and subsequently, their life.

2224,"sometimes I wonder if killing myself is the only way I can find peaceI'm 17 years old, I'm working a job I hate, and my anxiety about this pandemic has gotten me spiraling out of control  I think I'm poisoning myself with what I'm doing to keep myself from getting sick. I cant drink out of cans or bottles and I cant even eat sweets or chips without spraying it with lysol or using disinfecting wipes on them. I'm so scared of getting sick its unreal. I think I'm subsequently making myself sick in the process. my dads trying to get me to go on medication, but I dont think itll help.  I know I'm more lucky than others, i have a boyfriend that loves me and a family that tries to help but everytime i start to spiral it feels like they cant help me. hell, I tried to vent to my mom on the phone and she just started to cry saying she cant help me and to just give up if I'm not gonna accept her ""help"". I'm in my last year of school doing it all online and I cant do anything. I'm in lower classes bc my act score was shit, and everyone around me just makes me feel like a failure in comparison.  I don't know why I'm posting this, maybe I just want attention? idk. but I'm tired of waking up everyday at 2pm getting ready to go to a job that makes me feel miserable. the only thing that's given me any joy is engaging in any kind of sexual act(s) with my bf. I feel like a piece of shit. I feel sick. I just want this all to be over.  I thought moving to my dads house would make everything better, but it didnt. everything feels the same way. it just makes me think maybe the only way I'll ever truly find peace is when I go to heaven, if I'm even able to go with all the sinful things I've done to make myself feel any kind of emotion.  I feel bad for even posting this bc I know I'm more well off than others, but I'm truly just sick of living the way I do. it feels like theres no way out.",1,suicide

I've taken 4 migraine pils and a lortab today and got no sleep. How do I stop this....i don't know if I'm going to finish this night...i don't know what is going on. I've never felt myself fall apart completely until now...for those of you wishing for death, find someway to get help. If youre at the beginning stages of depression talk to somebody. Do something. This is hell. You are all holding the potential to become amazing people in the future. Please get help, I hate knowing that I am not the only one laying in bed right now, feeling my body let go. Nobody should have to feel this way. Nobody. Ever. Im begging you, take your life seriously and find a helper. Get somebody to help you before it's too late. please...just talk to somebody, a stranger, a friend, somebody....please...

So without rambling too much, I am having difficulty recalling what it is like to care about anyone (including myself).  It's like forgetting a long lost friend's name and face.  I know it was there at one time but it's been so long that I can't even fantasize about being that way again. I am desperately trying to get better, but slowly drowning.  I want to commit suicide *that is how I feel* although I don't think I am suicidal as I only imagine it now and have no real intentions of following through.  I can't even cry anymore, I am like the little dutch boy and it's my job to stay strong and continue my robotic existence to keep everyone else around me happy.",1,suicide

2375,Intrusive thoughtsSo the month of October was the worst month of my life. It started with my girlfriend of a year and a half breaking up with me because she had no more time to give to our relationship due to life choices that she had made involving prioritizing literally everything else over me. Ten days after that one of my friend who was 16 passed away after an a fall while hiking. Because of the stress and trauma my grades have plummeted and there is a class in college that I might fail and I not sure I have the energy to fix it. Additionally earlier in the year my high school band director who was like another mom to me passed away from cancer. Because of all this I have had thought of suicide that frankly scare me. For example I would find my self wishing that some thing would accidental kill or hurt me. The majority of the thought have been passive ideation but there are a few times that have had thought of actively ending my life.  I have friends that care about me but are not always available. Additionally I am scared to tell anyone of these thought. I honestly don't think I will do anything but I am scared none the less.,1,suicide

2388,"I wish I were dead, but I'm not an acute suicide riskThere, I put it out into the void. I wish I were dead.  More accurately, I want to be dead. And it's interfering with my ability to progress in my therapy because when I have a fleeting suicidal thought, I'm supposed to feel fear/revulsion, and eventually learn to let it go without having to engage it at all. However, what actually happens is a fleeting suicidal thought comes in and I feel hope. Sometimes I even feel a rush of relief if it's a particularly strong impulse. Like, ""maybe this time there's a chance lol nope."" So I have a bunch of secondary thoughts and have fully engaged with it before I'm even fully aware of it. But I'm not going to kill myself. That ship was already sailing before Coronavirus, and lockdown has guaranteed it. I'll say it again in hopes that maybe my damn brain will get it: I'm not going to kill myself. All I've been able to do at this point to ""disengage"" is tell myself that it's not happening during lockdown, and to come back at me when I can travel freely again and have a way to kill myself away from my spouse. I'm lying to myself - I won't be killing myself just because lockdown ends, but at least the lie lets me disengage. But I still can't move forward with my life either because I'm clinging to a hope of dying. I wish I weren't.

For this reason I know that I am useless and should die, but here's the real kicker: my anxiety doesn't allow me to kill myself. I do not know if I am suffering from chronic loneliness or depression. I don't cut, cry or smile like other depressed people. It seems like psychologically and spiritually, I am nothing. Though, I do currently retain some qualities, which I'll list here: - * Physical fitness is optimal with weight lifting and anaerobic exercise * Intelligence aptitude is optimal, with a verified IQ of over 153 (I don't give a fuck if you think that's pretentious) * Nutrition is optimal; I don't consume ANY drugs, not even processed sugar. * Hygiene is sound: I clothe, groom and clean appropriately. - On the surface it looks like I have everything I need. But on the inside I am void. If anyone has any suggestions, please respond.  ",1,suicide

For the last month I've had very high suicidal ideation, almost obsessive and there hasn't been a day where I haven't thought about it but for the past week I've progressively gotten worse. I've gotten to the point of deciding how I would do it, planning tying up different aspects of my life so that everything is ready. Planning what who would receive my possessions.  I'm now at a stage where I flat out want to do it and plan on it I just don't know if that'll be tomorrow or next week. It doesn't scare me, it's a little relieving thinking about it.  I have made attempts to talk to people about it but it was either brushed off or a quick sympathetic look and then nothing. I have also been in contact with my doctor about how I feel and they've referred me to a professional but that was 4 months ago. I've also been to therapy before and it freaked me out and I left. I don't even have a lot to complain about in my life rn, I have a partner, a job, great grades at university, friends. But no matter what I do I'm still desperately depressed and I'm sick of it. I've tried mindfulness, self help, medication and I always end up back here in the end.  Don't get me wrong I have been through hellish trauma in my life. I won't go into detail because it's a very sensitive topic and I don't want to trigger other people who have been through similar experiences.

2438,"My view on suicide as I agedNot currently suicidal, I have been on meds for a while and been going to therapy which have helped towards pushing those thoughts away. I wanted to just put my thoughts out there so I could get some feedback, and this is the only place I could think of that it wouldn't be so... out of place/I'd rather it be in a safer place. I also just started seeing a new therapist, and I want to digest this before I go see her so my thoughts are more developed. When I was in 7th to 9th grade, my thoughts of suicide came mostly out of anger, like I wanted the world to pay by using my corpse and suicide note as ammo (mostly due to lack of control, thinking that suicide was my final say) When it became 10th it changed into this weird 'suicide is illogical' which came from me bottling up my emotions which worked for a while. I still had the thoughts of using myself as ammo, just a new way to stop myself, an emotional wall really. Once I hit the 12th grade, I had a nagging voice in the back of my head that was basically a pessimistic asshole who would point out the flaws in everything, especially me. It would make me feel so guilty, for not only thinking of others so horribly, but also by making me think of all of my previous mistakes. It really added fuel to the upcoming fire Around junior year of college, I just broke down after a nasty breakup, the emotional walls I had previously broke, and I just lost the energy to get out of bed. I thought about suicide, but I just didn't have the energy at the time. Once I had partially regained my energy, I wanted to commit suicide, and then I would start picturing methods, aftermath, the cleanup and finally my parents, my family and friends mourning, and I felt that I just couldn't do that to them. The same strings I wanted to use as a child to get back at the world with were now holding me back as I pictured their mourning. I remember trying to write a thank you note to a friend that suddenly became a suicide note and just sobbing. After getting help, and staying up way too late tonight, I'm wondering if my old suicidal thoughts stayed with me all the way, or if they changed as I changed. The transition from angry to sad seemed a bit... odd",1,suicide

2470,"6 years of therapyMy story is way too long and I'm too tired of telling it, because I reached out for help, but nobody could.  So I will just tell you about my current status.  In the last 6 years I visited 10 different therapists, spent 6 months stationery and tried several anti-depressive medications.  I attended to therapy with different attitudes,  from a totally depressive, dysfunctional and suicidal wreck to slighty optimistic and willing to work on change, but it hasn't changed anything, besides that I'm clean and more socialized, without harming myself anymore, I still want to die, I still suffer from my emotional condition, for which I got diagnostic names now, and I still believe that I was born on the wrong planet, even tho I met some very pleasent individuals, but those keep distancing themselves from me and if they don't, they start to annoy me, so I leave them.  I'm going to school again, work part time and my sexlife was quite active for a while, I have to admit that things became better, but I still do not really enjoy anything, I still... want to die. And recently Chester Bennington ended his life, a man who sang about suffering from mental illness for over 20 years and who appears that he never overcame his condition. I doubt that I can find the strength for another 14 of what I'm going through.  The only reason I consider to not do it, or haven't done it yet is my mom, she's heartwarming and did so much for me during the last years, I don't want to hurt her, she's got enough shit going on in her life without her failure of a son disappointing her again. I feel miserable because I basically only live for her and that appears to make everything worse, I start to hate myself again for my deathwish, but what should I do about it, it's such a strong desire that no therapist and no stupid anti depressant could help me to overcome it.  I actually start to believe that I was meant to kill myself.

I've tried one shoddy attempt at suffocating myself once with a plastic bag and rope, but that was it so far. I do fantasize about it all the time, daily, even as I type this. I tried to talk to my dad about it  several times, but he thinks its just bullshit. I talked to my sister about it a lot, but she always seemed to just brush it off because  she went through a depressive streak and slashed her wrists, but got over it somehow.  She went and had a kid with an abusive drug addicted criminal, and now she is going through a nasty custody battle with him. I am being supportive, listening to her, being understanding, reassuring her, basically just trying to help her out as best as I can, and not stress her out. I also help her pay for some minor things and help babysit my nephew, as well go to court with her to give her a moral boost. She moved back in with me and our abusive parents, and I tried my damn hardest to make sure they focused most of their crap on me instead of her. She was only able to last a month with them.  So we go to court last week, nothing really happens but the crazy guy's lawyer scares the shit out of my sister, so she calls me hysterically crying saying she wants kill herself. I somehow manage to calm her down and cheer her up pretty quickly, we talk some more, and she hangs up. And now here is the problem, ever since that phone call I get extremely angry when I get my suicidal thoughts. It's like those thoughts have been a comforting thing for me, something I could control. When now I can't think about them, because if I go and off myself my sister and nephew will have no one to help them. Anyone have any advice? This shit makes my angry just typing it. **TL;DR:** Suicidal thoughts daily. Sister only semi supportive. Sister needs help, I help her. One day she calls me telling me she wants to kill herself.

I tried on the noose to test the durability of the rope, then tried it as an actual attempt, but I picked myself up because I thought of my castmates (I'm in a show at the moment for my school).  I don't know if my suicide would have the show canceled (we open on the 15th) or if everyone would be forced to do it under extreme sadness. And as a second thought, I wonder if people would even miss me, that if I killed myself, my castmates would have no problem continuing the show. I'm just tired of being around everybody while they're happy, and I'm not. I can't find my happiness. I can't find my will to live. I keep trying to leave, but then something positive happens with someone that makes me feel like ""now I can't leave because they'll be another person to leave behind,"" or if something negative happens with someone, I feel like they'd think I did it because of them. After a string of days of no one talking to me, I feel free enough to leave, but then something stops me. It's too bad whatever stops me can't be permanent. I'm trying to leave, but I don't want others to cry or feel guilty. I still have the noose set up. And I've been to the hospital already- voluntarily.

Sometimes I feel something and go through the reactions, but halfway through I'll realize that I'm not even feeling that emotion, just doing what I'm used to doing. If I ever get close to someone or something, I am filled with a horrible feeling of anger. When we first adopted my cat, I held her in my arms and she fell asleep. I was so uncomfortable and angry that I had put her down before I hurt her. When my mom tried on her wedding dress to show me, I felt so angry I was on the verge of tears and had to go be alone for the rest of the night. The minute I feel connected to anyone, a switch is flipped where bonds are now anger. Every single friend I've had, I've gone through around a year long phase where I CAN'T STAND them and am really awful towards them. All I want is to not be lonely, but the minute I have a chance at that, I physically can't be around that person or animal anymore. I don't mean any harm to people, I just can't control myself. I guess people don't see that though. People never get angry at me, they just sort of fade away. If life is all about the connections you make, so what am I supposed to do? One minute I'm content and perfectly fine, and not five minutes later I can barely stop myself from doing things that I won't go into detail about. There's about 1000 more things I could write about but I'll refrain.",1,suicide

2612,"Get yourself a friend who can point out all your flaws and still be a friend Obviously don't get into a toxic relationship with someone. If you're being abused in any way, contact help and leave the abuser as soon as you can. I mean make sure you have a friend who is close enough to point out mistakes and help you learn and grow as a person. Example: Yesterday I said something unknowingly offensive to some friends. This morning one of them confronted me. Harshly. I made someone upset due to my ignorance and social awkwardness/inability to explain myself (which I shouldn't blame but it did play a part in it). Thankfully we are all still friends and I've promised to learn from my mistakes. When someone points out your mistakes, accept their criticism and try to learn from it. It's natural to act defensive but showing someone you care and that you want to be a better person to them means a lot and could strengthen the relationship. I won't say what offensive thing I said. It was just an awkward comment that I explained very badly.",0,suicide

2614,"My friend commited suicide this week and made me want to do the same.I'll make this short, because I'm so exhausted of thinking tonight, perhaps I'll elaborate tomorrow. I've been suicidal for two years, made two half-assed attempts with pills and alcohol, and been hospitalised a few times. Before this, I was a happy, quite resourceful and hard working girl.  A few days ago, a friend of mine ended her life. I wasn't close to her but we are a very big group of friends now mourning and of course the big talking topic is suicide. Huge. Trigger. They are saying extremely offensive things which of course is because they don't understand what it it like to be suicidal. I was doing quite well before this happened, I've stayed out of hospitals since November. Got a puppy, changed my job.  and here I am, reading and obsessing over suicide methods and survival stories. I feel trapped, because I can't do this right after our other friend. Which they also remind be of every day. I feel trapped, extremely alone and very triggered.",1,suicide
2615,"I ruined my life a year ago. Now I want out.About 18 months ago I decided I was trans and started the process, even changing my name. I've never been less happy. I want my old self back. I no longer try to pass myself off as a woman but I have already changed my name and body. I am horrified at having to spend the rest of my life like this. When I see myself in the mirror I feel both a sense of immense detachment, scientific curiosity, horror, rage, regret... In retrospect I did this because my life was already sucking severely and I was (and still am) totally empty empty inside. I just had nothing else to pursue and I think, in part, I wanted to make myself interesting someway. I didn't do any research and just jumped right in, with nothing to lose I thought.  This is only one of the reasons I am getting close to suicide. I don't have any friends, career, or anything to fill this void. I have one hobby (music), but I am a hack and I think I'm too insecure at the core to really make anything resembling art . No confidence, no attention span. However after work I basically spend all day singing and playing and recording myself, much to my frustration as I sound flat and awful. My guitar hasn't ever helped me and this weekend I am planning on selling or donating all my gear. Recently my mom came to visit me and she stayed with me in my motel room that I live in. She seemed desperate to take me back home to the Midwest and turn my life around. I didn't go back. I really hope I can find a way out of this. To be honest I wonder if I'm just supposed to commit suicide. Perhaps my brain, already afflicted from chemical imbalance and lack of stimulation, staged its rebellion against the circumstances to push me to the brink.  I've definitely been prone to some self-destructive behavior in the past, but never went about something so impulsively before. ",1,suicide

My psychiatrist believes that depression is a teenage fad. I haven't made any friends since I was 12, and it was the only close friend I've ever had. We're parted now. I am truly alone.

So you chase the improbable, in the hopes your demons don't catch up - but slowly, so slowly, they edge closer as they cotton on to the bullshit.  I really shouldn't have anything to complain about - I'm 23, and for all intents and purposes my life is going places from the outside; earning more than 97% of the UK population as a senior cloud engineer, supplemented by a side hustle as a freelance consultant. Further, I'm a few weeks away from buying my first house, and owning it outright by the time I turn 40 (if not sooner). Society teaches that this is the pinnacle of success, so then why do I feel like I've already failed?  ... Well, I'll tell you - It's because I have nobody, not one person I'd count as a friend. Sure, I've met a plethora of people over the years - but not one gives a single damn, lest I have something to offer in return. And when people do approach, it's with a thin sheen of fake intent - A shimmer of self interest which quickly melts, replaced with some demand or high-level request. But when I ask for an inch in return, I'm required to claw the privilege. So why bother? What's the point? Honestly, what's the point in continuing with the great charade that's life? When all that it is, at its basis, is one giant game of give and take.  And when you finally do break through to someone, they tell you that you need to stop being a drama queen - that you need to stop making mountains where they need not exist. So, I re-iterate, what's the point? Everyone thinks you're walking some kind of golden path, when in reality I feel like I'm trying to swim through a patch of brambles - with the only thing anchoring me being the sheer pain I feel; war-gaming the various ways I could die, to find something I feel would be effective and relatively painless.

I get picked on for being ugly, and I already know I'm ugly, they don't need to point it out. Other than that I just feel trapped and lost. It feels like there's no hope anymore.

I feel this knot in my throat, something heavy pressing against my chest and I don't know how to get rid of it and I wanna do it on my own, I have always needed help with everything, I wasn't able to do something on my own without fucking up and I don't wanna bother people with my shitty teenager problems cuz what's the point on working on something of it's gonna go away at some point, because it *will* go away at some point I guess, I hope. I feel like I'm close to filling up the glass and when it overflows somebody will probably get hurt and I don't wanna do that but I don't know how to avoid it either. I also feel like it's wrong for me to feel like this, like I don't have a reason to be sad and should just stop bitching about every little thing, and that just makes it worse. I feel more like nothing important rather than less sad. I feel like I'm simply pathetic in everything, school, personal life, social life. There's just a lot of secrets I always kept to myself and I feel like telling them would make everyone laugh and move away from me and I hate the thought of being alone, I already feel alone and knowing this would make that feeling a reality is painful. Thanks for reading this shit, of you choose to say this is ""fake depression"" idgaf at this point, I just don't want to live with this shit in my head and wanna just feel, even for just a second, that doing this will help Sorry if I misspelled smn",0,suicide

Spent a lot of time reading philosophy to find answers. Why don't I care about money, a career, having children, anything at all and why don't I have any purpose in life? Nothing. Every day is a string of coping mechanisms designed to distract me from the fact that life is suffering. &amp;#x200B; In my late teens I had the misfortune of taking an interest in politics and without going into it to much I've found myself with very radicalized beliefs, to the degree at which I will be essentially closeted for the remainder of my life. Between my mental health and the existential end I no longer care to humor, my mind and spirit are completely broken. I'm in my mid-20's. Best case scenario I find a girl that won't treat me like a bronze medal, find the energy I had as a kid and use it to re-enter the real world... to blend in with the rest of society. So my family won't look down on me anymore for being the kid that threw away his life. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because my mom knows how miserable I am and has told me several times how her friends kids have killed themselves and how she'd never recover and probably divorce my dad. Living for the past decade has been nothing but despair and I don't even have the ego to save face anymore. Having to watch the rest of the world enjoy their lives with at the very least, a drive to exist is creating an envy I refuse to humor.

I liked it for a little bit until I realized that they would be staying with us for a long time (maybe even the rest of their lives). My house has 3 bedrooms. Here's what has happened: 1. My mom and sister sleep in the master bedroom. 2. My dad sleeps in the study on an ottoman which folds out into a bed. (Normally he would also sleep in the master bedroom but he's a doctor and is worried he may end up giving COVID-19 to everyone after he comes home from work.) 3. My grandma sleeps in my room. 4. My grandpa sleeps in my sister's room. (My sister doesn't sleep in her room, she just keeps her stuff there and sleeps in the master bedroom.) This more or less leaves me without a room to myself. This forces me to sleep in the family room or the formal living room (the place that guests sit when they come over). This leaves me without a place to work or keep my stuff (my grandma basically took over my entire room and she uses my desk all the time). My mom and dad are also getting a new house built and it's about halfway there, but the construction is going very slow (It's not because of the coronavirus, it's actually because the carpenter is making wooden fixtures for other houses while he is at our new house's construction site). Each time I tell my mom that I don't have my own place to work in my current house, she tells me that I just need to wait a few more weeks. But she's been saying this for over three months and there haven't been any significant advancements in construction at our new house (which will have enough bedrooms for me to have my own while my grandparents stay with us) since April.

Now I have to depend on my parents for rides to school and they can be very overbearing and make me feel worse.  I owe the school $1,500 in remaining tuition after aid and scholarships. And I still haven't been able to find the money for even payment plans. I I'm just so overwhelmed. I am also a transfer student from last year, so I already have basically no friends in school since I also commute and know no one still. I always feel so alone on campus since Im one of the only minorities. I also have mild OCD, dysthymia, and social anxiety disorder, It makes everything so hard.  I have an internship three days a week, I'm in my senior year of college. I have so many bills to pay now. I have no car. My depression is getting worse and I'm feeling more alone everyday. I have one friend to talk to but he has other things to deal with and I don't wanna keep burdening him.  My cousin killed himself 3 months ago and I kind of feel jealous of him since he doesn't have to deal with the stress anymore. I just feel like I need someone to talk to.",1,suicide

2746,"Transitioning into the planning phase.I've been fighting depression for over 15 years, and late last year I finally took the first steps towards getting treated. Got officially diagnosed, got pills, started therapy. And yet, 2016 has been the worst fucking year. New pills messing with my head, new boyfriend hit me so I broke up with him, my grandmother died, I was fired from my job less than a week after returning from her funeral, and that left me with two days remaining that month to use my insurance for oral surgery that had to be planned last-minute (I got VERY lucky with my dentist). And because I'm in the US, losing my job meant losing access to my doctor and therapist before I really made any progress at all. I have pills left, but those are expensive and being unemployed, there's not exactly a lot of spare cash to go around. I've reached the point where I'm starting to plan. Method is easy, I have everything I need for that. I'll just unlock my front door so no one has to break it down, and the timing will be a few days after rent is due so I know someone will be coming to my door. Student loans go away upon death, so I don't have to worry about anyone being saddled with those. My only other debt is my car, and it's worth more than the loan so that doesn't really matter. Other than writing note(s) and giving my apartment a really solid cleaning, I don't see anything else to do to prepare. I won't be going to a better place. I'll be going to a quiet place, where I have no awareness, where my treacherous mind can no longer eat me alive. I just won't wake up anymore. And that's okay.",1,suicide

I feel lost and I feel hurt and angry. her life was worth more than she could ever imagine. She was my best friend. my only sister. We were supposed to grow old together and take care of our parents until their time to pass came. Now I have to take care of burying her.

She was always so cheerful and positive that I failed to see that something was wrong. Her daughter will never know the love her mother had for her apart from what we tell her. She won't grow up being able to have those deep conversations with her mother. I miss her. I feel lost without her. Please if you are going through something like this, talk to someone. I guarantee you that someone cares. Someone loves you and wants to have you in their life. Dying isn't the answer. I now have to struggle to raise up money for her funeral. A funeral that if I had paid more attention we wouldn't  be having. don't break your families hearts. Talk to someone. talk to me if you have no one else you trust.

2759,"Men's shorts that go more than an inch or two above the knee look extremely awkward. TL;DR I don't even like shorts that go too much above the knee on women, much less so on men. Super long baggy cargo or basketball shorts or whatever that go all the way to mid-calf are a bit much, I'll admit...but we do not need to swing so far into the opposite direction either. To me, shorts should fall around the knee. An inch or two below or above is fine, but too far into either direction is bad. However...people in my area, and /r/malefashionadvice seem to have developed some sort of thigh fetish to compensate for previously too long shorts.

It's fucking sad that if I killed myself people would use that for sympathy, some people would be relived that this has happened, Why are people so dumb and have no consideration for others, people are just using each other constantly and I just want to be on my own. People only ""care"" for one another because of how it makes THEM feel, as soon as they find a better version of this they'll stop caring and move on.  I don't agree with life, I'm angry and I don't want to be here. Why do I keep pushing myself to tolerate people that are just selfish, everyone is just constantly trying to protect their pride and hold up a facade of who they are.  I'm tired of pretending, just fuck everyone. I have no faith in humanity, everyone is out for something.  And why does no one care about mental health, why am I told to just get on with it, why have I been on a waiting list for over 1.5 years.  I know I don't sound like I am, but I honestly try and be a good person so much and go out of my way for others. But other people have been so self absorbed they don't even realise and think they're entitled, if it was the other way around they wouldn't do it for me. And I think it's sad because when I tell people this they say, just concentrate on yourself. WHY, why can't people just have consideration for one an another. ",1,suicide

We'd been together for over two years and she recently moved to Australia and dumped me because of my depression and anxiety. This was a couple weeks ago now, I have since stopped talking to her and we are no longer friends. I think I took the high road by being nice with her throughout despite feeling hurt.  I miss her so much though. She broke my heart and I don't think I can ever take her back, but I miss what we had. Things have been going well for me lately. I'm in university and I got a scholarship, I got approved to do an international exchange in Europe (I'm from Canada), and I got a co op job for the summer.  Not only that, I've been seeking help for my depression and I have anxiety drugs. Yet I feel like my life is no longer in my control. The problem is: I can be a somewhat impulsive person.

I've worked before in fast food restaurants, but I had to stop due to a health problem. I now can't really work because of this health problem. However, I am doing uni.  The uni is the only thing going for me. I can't work and I have to see my father and mother, who are both very tired and have physical pains from repetitive work, go out and cover my ass. Me and my fiancee also broke up, because of various problems. I thought that after I went back and focused on what I was doing it would get better. But no. I have noticed my lack of ability in all forms, such as in English, maths, basic knowledge, skills in videogames, music (I play guitar), editing, basically everything.... All the things I like doing don't bring me joy and I suck. I sleep about 14 hours a day and whenever I wake up I just want to die. I just don't feel like life is worth it and I'm definitely not anything that needs to be alive. I can't be bothered to go anywhere anymore and life is on autopilot. Even my friends are calling me out on my lack of abilities on games. I feel tired of being alive. I think that I should put the effort and get better at things and try to continue, but I feel like I can't be bothered. I just don't get joy from it anymore or maybe I'm so sad that it doesn't matter. When I was a kid I believed that I was going to be good at something. However, that could not be further from the truth. I am so mediocre it's insane. I am a terrible human being also, coward and afraid of everything regarding my future.

This person had suicidal depression and low self esteem. By the time I made my mistake I had finally gained their trust and built a stable relationship with them, just to ruin it all. We could've been so happy together and I ruined it. Gaining their trust took such hard work, and we had many ups and downs, and after I ruined everything it became worse than anything I've ever experienced with them. The heartache lasted a few more months and during that time I believe I've developed anxiety and depression, though I guess I can't be too sure. I do know that I've had mentle breakdowns over them and I hate myself so much to the point where I feel like dying sometimes. Recently they've decided that the heartache wasn't worth it and have found someone to replace me, but has also told me that they're not fully over me yet. I decided that I deserved to be replaced and that I owe it to them to help them move on from me, since it's all my fault. I tried my best to help them but being replaced like that was too much for me to handle and I ended up abandoning them instead. I should've never done it. They'll have a harder time without me and there's a fair possibility that they'll kill themself because I decided to leave their life. The guilt and uncertainty is too much to handle and I've found myself crying too many times in one day to keep track of now. I've tried reaching out to them again but they want nothing to do with me and told me that they can't promise me they'll be ok, but that they also don't want me in their life anymore.

2951,"I don't want to die but that's where things seem to be heading.I don't want to die. I don't want to go, I don't want to leave all of the people I care about behind. But I feel like that's where I'm headed. It's that same feeling when you wake up in the morning and the bed is nice and comfy. Maybe you are even a bit sick. You tell yourself ""I don't want to get up. I don't want to go to class. I don't want to go to work."" But no matter how many times you tell yourself this, you know that you are eventually going to get up and do what needs to be done.  I feel like that right now. Part of me has taken it as an inevitability and is waiting for the time. I find myself making lose plans. Part of me is fighting back, trying to throw up as many safeguards as I can.  When the suicidal part is in control, I find myself slipping in messages of ""help me"" into conversations, but nobody ever listens and nobody comes to help. When my rational mind is in control, I find myself unconsciously making small preparations.  This war in my head is really tearing me apart. I can't do anything at times, I just lie/sit there or mechanically go through whatever needs to happen. We had a big career fair at my school this week and I couldn't even manage to go there because the depression hit so hard, even though I know that I need to go because I need to get a job for the next summer. If I even make it to next summer.   I'm not making a positive change in the world and my existence only hurts people. Any good I do like with the guy from last week I just feel like I'm attoning for the terrible things that I've done. but I know that some things about me won't and can't change, so I know I will hurt people in the future. I'm writing this as someone with some sense of control right now. I know that all of these thoughts, including the suicidal ones, are mine. It is me and I am it. I just don't know how much longer I get to be myself. ",1,suicide
2952,"Just... tired. Running out of reasons to keep going.I don't really know where to begin and I've attempted to post here before but I never end up submitting anything. Once I start typing it comes out all wrong and ends up being just a mountain of text and I never feel like I've actually said anything. So, I'll try to keep it short and concise.  Basically, I've been sad for a while, but I was drinking heavily and that made things better because at least I didn't have to feel. I had this amazing magical substance that gave me control over my emotions. Then my mom died and then within three months I got sober. I've had a couple ""baby"" relapses, but they weren't shit. I didn't feel better. It wasn't like before. Drinking didn't make me feel good. Nothing makes me feel good. Instead, I just get angry. I'm angry and I lash out at those closest to me. But lately I've begun to feel this sense of overwhelming frustration. Towards everything. My friend's don't understand. I try to explain but then I just get told how I'm being ridiculous or irrational or how I ""need to calm down."" I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't go out anymore. Being around my friends makes me angry. I feel like I can't explain my feelings in a way that will make them understand. So why bother? I treat my friends badly because I want them to feel as miserable as I do. Because then they would understand. I feel tired and defeated; a slave to my emotions. I'm getting locked into a state of constant bitterness.  I just really need to know that someone understands.",1,suicide

2965,"Don't know what to doEvery day there's nothing I can do but stay still. I have to sit or lay down somewhere. I'm never comfortable. I always have neck pain or back pain or a headache or tooth aches. It's always something. I can't focus my mind and I get anxious and pent up when I'm still. When I leave my house I get anxious and feel like I disgusting stain on this beautiful Earth. I reach out to people and only seem to be assured that things are fine for everybody else and that I'm lesser than them. That I'm not worth the time or effort and I get vague promises that things will get better. I've been decaying for a long time. My thoughts are erratic and my mind is in a constant fatigued fog. Paranoia and existential dread have become constant companions. I feel like I'm ready to drop everything and just run however I can. Maybe buy a new car and just drive across the country. While that's a nice romantic thought, I know the reality would be worse than what I have now. I would feel pent up in my car. I would become uncomfortable. It would suddenly dawn on me how far I am from home and I would have an anxiety attack. I would worry about the people I left behind and that I might regret it if something happened. They would worry about me too. It's like there is no escape at all. I don't want to live in this fucking body anymore. It's constantly in pain and it's hideous. I just want to hide away but every day I melt a little bit more. I'm in such a damn hopeless mood right now. None of my past friends or lovers or their promises matter anymore. They're all gone. Every single one. I didn't have the privilege of going out in a blaze of glory and now it seems like I will rather slowly lose myself over time like so many have until there's nothing left. Just stewing in my own agony until I have a heart attack or get cancer. Happiness just a pipe dream of the past. I don't know what I did or am doing wrong. I don't know why I don't deserve happiness or friendship. All I know right now is this horrible pain and I have no way to escape. ",1,suicide

2970,"Some people were never meant to be aliveI thought I had beaten my suicidal tendencies. My entire life I have thought I would be the cause of my own death. I remember being five years old and wishing I owned a gun so I could kill myself. Until I was 20 those compulsions haunted me. I tried multiple times... Petty attempts. Never for attention because nobody knows but me. I cut myself, I starved myself, I emotionally beat myself up daily.  I thought the depression passed after I tried MDMA and LSD for the first time a year ago. All of 2012 was a year of forgiveness, self exploration, and love. But I have since gotten the message and hung up. I truly hate all that I am- this hatred goes much deeper than I could ever express in words. I've spent years trying to change bits of me that I disliked, but in the end I realized I am who I am and I cannot change me.  I don't want to die. I want to live and be happy. But I cannot go on living the way that I've been. I honestly believe some people were never meant to be alive, and I am one of those people. Consciousness is the enemy of humans; it is far too powerful for our purposes. I often think myself into depressions and the more I think about life, the more existentialistic I become.  I am extremely intelligent, too intelligent. I want to live, but I am ashamed of who I am. Truly.... I am embarrassed of myself. I don't know what I expect from this post, I guess I just wanted express my thoughts. The only thing keeping me here is the thought of how sad my mother would be if I beat her to a grave. ",1,suicide

I volunteered for crisis Text Line and I still find myself wondering how pointless for me to help them. I start wondering when am I allowed to be selfish. Why is it that even when I plan my suicide, I would consider ways to make it look like an accident to save others the truth. To die in a way my organs could be salvaged for others to live from. When does it become okay to be selfish and want someone to cherish and love me... To be that kind of selfish where I can be clingy and desperately claw onto someone for their love... To not feel like I'm desperate and that it is ok to have someone I want to selfishly have all to myself... I feel like I'm chained because I'm thinking of others first ... When is it OK to be greedily selfish... I hate how every thought of wanting to reach out feels like an attention grab... That all I do is cry each night missing the people I had in my life... That I only lived this far is because I always did it for others... I feel alone. People say that you aren't, but you are. A touch, a hug, a kiss is only skin deep. What I feel, only I will know alone. They cannot share my feeling because it is mine, not ours. It is the thought that they can only understand to a point because they are not me.

When getting no good grade, they feel like a second-class citizen. The only way to leave that state is to study, but I can't, I don't know how to. I feel like shit in the sigh of society and my own family. my self-esteem has almost nothing left, feeling depression and a coward when asked by society but I couldn't say anything.

I can't find the answer even I have known the questions before.i must memorize all the answer like the child, working only an easy work that anybody can. I feel awkward, no society, no relationship. I must endure when I was bullied because of my face. every time I was suffering, I would sleep. Sleeping is a way that I feel good or doing useless thing, losing money and health so others think I am not interested in studying because of that. why don't I wanna make it better, but the result has never been good. I feel no exit for a long time but not forever. Crying and thinking to die every day, I am unbearable with this circle, only 1 step left, I almost have jumped. I thought to resign but I feel it is hard to be here(i am on the clinic(5 years) only 1 year left to finish). if I have graduated, everything gotta be fine. thinking makes me crazy, i is hard to choose to resign or not, even I know I can't do anymore, I fear to feel suffering forever when choosing the wrong way.

I told her about my depression and possible DID; she believed she could help. However I began to want to end it all; I began cutting ties. I quit my sports team that I had participated in for 6 years. I began avoiding my friends. My mind convinced me to distance myself from her. Not only that, but make me unattracted to her. I couldn't be intimate in our last month, I didn't want to kiss her the last week or two. I ended our relationship without a real explanation. I was going to end my life.  Three months have gone by. I met her mother the other day at the store and she revealed that my ex is worried about me. I was planning to reach out to her, and now I had no choice. I called her and we talked about our first year of college for 58 minutes, then she had to go.  My question is: do I reveal the real reason I left her, or do I leave her in mystery? If I tell her, I'm admitting the reality of my past situation and may cause her to worry and possibly feel guilt that she wasn't there to help.

Sometimes I wake up my girlfriend (and she gets sleepy grumpy, though she does her best to hide it), just to hold my hand... But there's nothing she can do to help. She can just get upset from watching me suffer, and then I feel bad for putting her through it, so I stopped. I call other friends sometimes, one in particular stays up way too late, but talking to people doesn't fix me.

It showed his true colors. he called me pathetic, he said that i was faking my depression and my anxiety, and that if I couldn't handle pushing carts that i should just give up. give up on getting a new job, dont bother going back to school. i tried. its been like a month, but im so tired. i dont think i can try anymore. this person had been my friend for most of my life, he was one of the first to know when I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and aspergers aside from my family. now he just keeps posting about online, and I only found out because someone told me.

I get carried away by my own thoughts. *And not to mention* that I can't remember shit. It's only getting worse, too, as I fall deeper into depression; a few months ago, I just forgot what homework I had or what I left in my room, *now?* Now, I can't even remember what day it is.

I'm about to go to sleep now after pulling an all-nighter in an attempt to correct my body clock. I feel pretty awful. The world seems very dark right now, my life has no meaning. I cried really intensely about an hour ago, almost screaming at times. I've been feeling depressed for years, and seriously suicidal for months, but something changed today. All hope seemed to just vanish, and I cried because it really is over now, there's no more excuses. My life is over, there's really nothing left to live for. I thought I had something to hold on to but my faith in that going well has almost left me now. I have no career, no loving family, no friends, no interests, no passions...

3190,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want to go back to the psych wardI was recently admitted to a psych ward for a suicide attempt. The first night sucked. I didn't get any sleep in the ICU, and the people around me scared me. But after a night's sleep, I sort of started to like it. I felt like a child again. My love of reading returned for a very short time. When I was there, I got through a book in two days, just like I used to when I was a kid. We had an art class, and I was drawing and coloring in a colorful room. I felt so happy and childlike. I haven't felt that for a long time. At first, I fought so hard to get out because I was so very scared, but God I want that feeling of a child back so much. I had to get out fast because I knew every night I spent there put my family out $1000 of dollars. (US healthcare system) I'm doing worse now. I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I told my family I'm trying to get back in college, even though I've been ignoring all the college emails. My meds aren't working, and my psychiatrist is all booked. My therapist is making me feel like absolute shit. I don't even have a job. All I do is lay in bed on my phone wishing I was dead. My only two friends are burnt out by me because I constantly go to them with my problems. I'm writing a bunch of suicide notes now. Don't have an exact plan, but I don't feel like I'm gonna be around for much longer given the current state of everything. Life sucks, and I want to go back to being a carefree child, and the psych ward was the closest thing I got to that. But I can't afford it, and this shitty healthcare system is gonna put me and my family I'm debt if I go back. I'm at a loss and just want to end it.",1,suicide
3191,"DoneI don't know if I'm actually going to kill myself or not, but I don't want to be here anymore. I don't talk about these thoughts with anyone because it's literally pointless. I don't really have anyone in my life anymore who I'm close to. I have been suicidal before. Sometimes I do get a little better - I can feel happiness sometimes. But it just never seems to stay and I'm so tired of the pain. I know people say that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but it's not in my case. I have been in therapy for four years now, I have taken medication and nothing helps. It feels like if I keep going I'm basically living the rest of my life as a hospice patient anyway. Every low just seems to get lower, happiness is never permanent but I struggle to make peace with the fact that I can't hold onto it, I'll never hold onto it. Things get better, then they get dark. I don't see the point of this world anymore, except to just suffer. That's what it always comes back to. I've posted on here before and I always try to justify why I feel the way I feel. But there's no justification, except that I'm tired. And no, this isn't getting better and this isn't going away. I don't relate to others beyond superficial things, but I try. I just don't. I don't have a place here, my own family doesn't even want the real me, just the image of something I'm not.  I hate myself at this point. Part of me wants to believe there is somewhere in existence where I won't feel this way, but that rug always gets pulled out from under me and all I'm left with is the reality that I am a subpar human, any effort to improve myself is ultimately a waste because everytime I think I have made progress my life gets worse. I might as well be a piece of shit if I keep on living but I can't live with that either. So what am I left with? So there it is, that's how I feel. I don't know what else is worth saying. Honestly, probably none of this was worth saying. ",1,suicide

3247,"Why does suicide seem rational to me?While I do suffer from depression, I am getting treatment for it, and I am in no imminent danger from self-harm, nor do I have a plan for suicide.  But I have been thinking about it quite a bit, and I believe that the more I think about it, the more suicide seems like a rational - rather than emotional - option.  I believe I am at the peak of my potential as a human being. I am likely never to find a life-long mate.  I believe that my best days are behind me, and that I don't have the ability to accomplish much more for either my own selfish benefit or for society as a whole.  While friends and family would be hurt by my suicide (and indeed, this is the most compelling reason not to), I believe that if that was not a factor, I don't really have a whole lot of reason to keep on living.  In short: throughout my adult life, each year has been worse than the one before it, economically, politically, emotionally, physically.  And while I have simple joys from time to time, I also have near-constant suffering.  My current day-to-day activities are hardly what I'd call ""accomplishments.""  I have written a book which no one would read, I feel that my career skills are obsolete, and that I lack the ability to go back for some sort of retraining.  I believe that the societal problems will only get worse, and that we are headed for a violent breakdown, and to be honest, I'd rather not deal with that.  Again - I have no real plan for suicide, and I wouldn't consider myself ""at risk.""  But the more I think about it, the more I consider not existing as superior to existing; it is not that I want to die, or that I want to cease to exist; but rather, I feel like I am a waste of resources.  We are given a limited time span in which to accomplish things, but I feel I cannot accomplish anything of value.  So, there's little point in delaying the inevitable.  What are your thoughts?

If they do, it's because they are legally required to, not because they were going to anyways. Incident at my school happened about a year ago. Friend of mine attempted suicide and there was a whole thing about it. School only gave a fuck because our parents got involved. Suicide posters also went up after this incident. Flash forward to right now. All of my friend are experiencing some kind of abuse, from mental, to physical. And they don't want to go to guidance office because they don't trust them to do anything. I think that should change. Guidance counselors are supposed to be people you can trust. And if the students feel that they can't trust them than they are doing something wrong.

I'm 28, I'm a good looking dude, my girlfriend is hot as fuck, I make bank, great family, friends, etc. I am not sad. I am not angry. I'm totally indifferent. Bored even.

Every day is exactly the same, and I wouldn't change it because I like it, but I'm over it. Does that even make sense? It's like if you go to Disney world, and it's great. You go on everything, you see all the attractions, and now it's time to go. It's not like you suddenly don't like Disney world. You just have no desire to re ride the rides. The trip is over. This is how I've felt for years. I've slowly stopped doing everything I've always liked to do because I've taken those things as far as I care to. And now it's like... I need to watch myself get old and die over the next 40 years? Why? I don't want to get married, and I never want kids. There's nothing left to do. I used to think I was depressed. I tried celexa, Zoloft, wellbutrin, and another I can't remember. I've had a series of sessions with a therapist. It almost seemed like she was at a loss for what to suggest.

You see, I'm autistic and while my family members do know this, sometimes I can accidentally do things that are very rude without meaning too because of it. However, what I said was very uncharacteristic because normally I'm not this rude when I am accidentally rude, but I digress; My aunt was about to log off the video chat, and I decided to make a joke so I said ""wait, who are you again?"" and I was going to follow it up with something else but after I said that I froze after I realized what I had just said and then my aunt hung up.  So naturally, I was upset asf after realizing how rude I was, so I ended up cussing up a storm which only pissed my stepdad off even more however he ended up comforting me but not even TWO SECONDS after I exited the room, he went to go talk to my mother and say that I was stupid asf and tell her about what I had said to my aunt before she left.  And then my mom was also like wtf and then I realized the magnitude of what I had just done, as my aunt is a major narcissist and would most definitely use it against me, *ESPECIALLY* my parents.  So I went and apologized to my aunt, and she said it was fine and so did my dad, given that he said had my aunt actually heard it she would've been blowing up my parent's phones, and I'm sure she hasn't either but now my stepdad thinks I'm fucking stupid and so does my mother and now I want to go curl up into a ball and jump off a cliff into a pit of hellfire. :D TL;DR: Accidentally said something rude asf to my narcissistic aunt and mild chaos insued.",0,suicide

3326,"I(22) feel suicidal because of the abusive relationship I had with my parentsGrowing up, I was always made to believe that I am an unbearable and problematic child especially by my sister, and my parents ignored any kind of abuse I would recieve. ""I bet your personality is so disgusting that you make the people around you hate you. I feel bad that your bullies even have to see you."" ""Shut the f up and stop crying so we can sleep"". Always looking at me with disgust when I struggled. Believing I am lying and looking for attention. Any time I confronted them about it the answer would be the same. ""We didn't mean it in that way honey, you just take everything too seriously"". I started believing them, hating myself and thinking I'm useless. Recently, after 22 years, I finally realized the abuse I have been through, that it is not normal and not my fault. And now it makes me extremely severed from reality. I feel like I don't know my personality, I don't know who I am, everything feels so lonely and painful. I am fairly hardworking, really cheerful and positive during the day, and have a lovely and understanding lover. Yet at nights I feel extremely severed from reality and lonely. I do extreme amounts of useless spending just to feel connected to something, eating up all of my savings. Wake up crying in hysterics in the morning. I have never thought about suicide before due to guilt but it feels like I care less and less. Recently I had a horrible fit and my lover stopped me as I went to the kitchen to get a knife. My family has been feeling guilty and trying to fix some of their mistakes in the past months, that only makes me realize the reality of their abuse and makes everything worse. Anything that reminds me of my sister sends me into a traumatic state. I have a psychiatrist I see every other month but that feels so far away and few. I don't even know how I would explain myself, because it's still hard to believe the problem is not me. I don't know how to feel connected. My country doesn't have a suicide hotline, I really don't know what to do.",1,suicide

I'm not rich or anything (hell, I don't even think I'm middle-class) but I've had no life-threatening illnesses, no car accidents, no bar fights, no psycho ex girlfriends, no identity theft, no legal trouble. This is why my psychiatrist told me five years ago that ""you always like to look like you're struggling."" This is why whenever something terrible happens to one of my friends, I always feel a subtle twinge of jealousy. (And then I rush in and help them out. But that's another story.) This is why all my daydreams involve me getting into some sort of trouble. My life is BORING. If there were any genuine hardship in my life, then, by dealing with it, I'd finally be able to find out what kind of person I really am. My question is: how do I attract trouble to myself?",1,suicide

I have been having suicidal thoughts over the last month.  Mostly minor things I could handle, but today it started feeling serious.  I am generally a happy, fun-loving guy.  However, I feel frayed.  Broken. Today is my birthday, and so far only my family has wished me a happy B-day.  It sounds lame, but no comments on facebook, no texts from friends.  I have realized I have very few friends.  Looking back, I realize that every group of friends I have ever had has divorced me in some way.  I am the common denominator.  Something is wrong with me.  The cycle is starting to repeat itself. I see all my old friends and they are doing awesome.  My used-to-be best friend hangs out with his circle...a circle that I started, and no one wants anything to do with me. I have applied for OCS three times and have been rejected three times.  I applied to law school and just received my rejection letter.  Applying to these things is no easy task.  It took me weeks, months and years to prepare myself.  I feel like I can't win.  I don't bitch to anyone because I want to seem like I have everything together.  It's slipping.  I am afraid I can't handle another rejection.  I keep trying and trying and trying with not so much as a ""nice try"" from anyone. I can feel myself slipping.  My mind wont shut off and it is overwhelming me.  I am engaged to the love of my life whom I have been dating for over 4 years.  I know I love her...but things are changing in me.  I am so frustrated.  We moved into a new place and I have spent thousands (THOUSANDS!!!!!) in appliances over the last week.  She is beginning to feel distant to me, despite us moving in together.   I am going bald at 24, losing friends, rejected from everything I worked for.

My depression symptoms always get the better of me and I find myself struggling to get out of bed and unable to go to class or do my work. I've almost failed out threee times. I'm hopelessly in love with a girl who won't love me back and my social anxiety makes it practically impossible to talk to anybody else. I've been on Tinder for two straight months with no matches. There is absolutely nothing about me that could be considered attractive to the opposite sex. Im fat, hairy, short, I have acne and bad teeth, a small penis and no self-confidence. For these reasons, I have never so much as held hands with a girl and nobody would even fathom the concept that they might like me. A major symptom of my anxiety is that I am often unable to come up with something to say in general conversation. I am left in a constant state of awkward silences and I feel as though my friends are starting to get tired of it. My family life is shit. Nobody in my family talks to each other and I am left as the intermediary between a dozen different groups. It's become so overwhelming that I've found myself shutting off different family members. To top it all off, I haven't been able to get a job in over two years. All my interviews go about the same as my conversations; awkward silence and nervousness.

3401,"Death is a friendHaving one of those moments where I had realized I can fight suicidal thoughts and be happy. Started off this year with registering to do a post graduate course. I was passing and failing but that was the juice of life, I convinced myself. I have had more than 6 years of weekly suicidal thoughts so I knew how pessimism can be so I was still fighting. Around Oct I was diagnosed with a fatal disease. I thought to myself ""wow, maybe I truly need to die.."" but I wanted to fight first. I thought maybe all these things happening are paving a way for this post grad to come to fruition. I worked for it and I was constantly scared of what might happen as soon as it doesn't work out as every odd has proven that"" things don't get better"" I received my results today and unfortunately I did not make it. Apart from the fact that this has given a good green light for the suicide but I am in disbelief. How can God be so silent. How can the universe be so unkind.  Not only am I finishing a glass of wine, didn't go to work, staring at 45 pills in front of me but I am also calmly thinking a about it all.  One of the most terrifying cognitive dissonance is learning that there's what we call optimism and all the dynamics of it are not applicable in my own life even though they are meant for me.  This probably will serve as a suicide note, but I have got a couple ones in my diary. It feels like I'm about to go on a journey as I am about to drink these pills. It feels like a new hope to find the truth. Whatever and wherever it is, I hope it bring me redemption",1,suicide

Lost the woman I love because of my increasing mental instability. Gotten a felony. Acquired substance issues. I'm homeless.  My parents are moving out of state next year. My transportation doesn't work, the guy I bought it from is ignoring me even though he owes me a spare engine. I have 4 misdemeanor charges to go to court for in the next month alone. 3 of them this week on my birthday. All my stuff has been stolen. I'm sleeping on concrete and I have no blankets and it's in low 40s. I have no money for food until the 8th. My wallet is stolen so the only work I can get is manual labor and not even on a payroll because I don't have an I'd or social security card to prove who I am.  I was called terrifyingly evil by the woman I asked to marry. I've been victim to hate crimes as I was beat on by five guys while in jail for being bisexual.  I have no friends or family that can or is willing to help me. I've started Self harming by cutting my arms. I constantly think of suicide and everyday I fight the urge to break down crying. Today I couldn't stop and I'm still sobbing as I type this. I've been applying to jobs but no one wants to hire a felon. And even though I'd pass a background check in 2018, with current record, it's likely I'm going to get either a couple misdemeanors or 3 might be changed into a felony as are for same thing.  Being hit by those 6 cars has left my body scarred and in pain. I have ptsd and anxiety from them. If a car turns just so in front of me while headlights are on I relive my first accident, which I was told should have killed me.  I just want to be dead so my suffering will end. I've tried to keep my head up for so long but I just can't do it anymore. I'm broken. I've been warped from a kind sweet hearted man to a sadistic depressed asshole.  My father is the only one in my family that even talks to me and he is going to another state. I'll never see him again. I have no one and nothing and I don't want to do this anymore.",1,suicide

She is beautiful and taken, and religious differences mean we probably couldn't last anyway.

She starts feeling conflicted and guilty and I'm feeling tortured. I love her so much. I'll never find someone like her. She makes me feel amazing yet awful. ""I find you more attractive because I can't have you"" that's just insulting. But yes you can! Please! I'd do anything to be with you. But it's never going to happen. I've dropped out of school.

It's not just because of this girl but I feel so hopeless about her right now.  I asked if she could change anything about me what would it be? She said if I was Mormon again. That's the one thing I wouldn't do. I'm still in fucking shock for seeing the church for what it is: Manipulative, elitist, homophobic, sexist, and obviously fabricated.

I have read through the two links in the subreddit that specified methods of talking with someone who is dealing with thoughts of suicide. I am not a very well equipped person when it comes to social skills. After reading through the tactics used I am still worried about this persons well being. They commonly talk about death, avoiding the word suicide, and about hiding their emotions emotions to those around them. I'm currently talking with them about their take on the way things have played out in their life. I'm trying to use the tactic of open ended questioning to learn and try to go to the depths of their darkness with them, but I'm not sure what other tactics might work? I'm attempting to be an active listener, while trying to dig deeper to better understand the person. Granted I've only know the individual for a little over a year now, I'm determined to see that they at least don't feel alone if they should find that death is their only option.

3444,"Parent Appreciation I don't really know what this post is, but I wanted to say some stuff and the people here tend to be really good listeners in my experience so here I am. I love my parents. So freaking much. They are the best people I know. I know plenty of people say this, and I think the conclusion I've come to is that all of them are right. Because anyone who believes they have the best parents in the world have the best parents they could have. Every person is different, right? So doesn't it make sense that everyone has different ""perfect"" parents? Maybe I'm nuts but I just feel like parents don't get the appreciation they deserve sometimes. I'm going to college for my second semester at the uni I worked my ass off in high school to get into. It was my dream to go there for 4 years and now that I can say I've taken a full semester of classes, I can honestly say that I miss my home so much. I wanted to leave home for years. I told my parents I wouldn't call, wouldn't text, and that once I was gone, I was gone. I wanted to mean it I think because I thought I was being independent. That if I did really cut them out, that I had achieved something. But I realize now that not only was I a total douche canoe, but I was also incredibly wrong. They've done more for me then I could ever ask other humans to do. They have dedicated the last 18 years of their lives to me and making sure they did their best for me. Imagine that! Seriously, think for one second about taking that much time out of your life entirely for a different person. It's astounding to me how much they genuinely care for and love me. I wasn't always the best person, and I certainly still have a ways to go, but never have they abandoned me. Every time I've screwed up, or really been down and out, they're there. And that's the most incredible thing to me. If you're reading this, and you think you have the best parents in the world, please tell them. For my sake, go tell them that. I'm sure you're right. Because for you, they're probably better than mine. But I know that for me, my parents are the best people I could possibly ask for. Thanks Mom and Dad.",0,suicide

I know she means well but to me it sounds like she's saying ""you're no different, everyone else is doing this too and they're not a dramatic fuck."" Cause I know I'm being a sensitive, overdramatic, ungrateful, annoying piece of shit. I know everyone around me is done with me at this point. They love me but I know I'm a burden on their life. I make everything a big deal for them. I make everything some kind of movie where I have to be the little victim. I want to switch to homeschool but it's going to be expensive and I don't want to make my mom go through anything more for the stupid little bitch I am.  Nothing helps now. If it does, it's very short term. I try drawing and listening to music, the only things I like now. But then I realize my art sucks and I can't draw anything well, and the music I'm listening to is all from a time where I was happy and not so messed up. Then I realize how meaningless and stupid the world is. I hope someone can just take me out easily, quickly, and painlessly, without traumatizing my family.",1,suicide

Since COVID has blown up, we haven't been able to see each other or talk that much (about 7ish months). We both miss each other know that we want to hang out, but I'm scared about how she suggested it. There's a movie coming out and there is only one showing of it close enough to us. This means there will most likely be more people there to watch since it's limited.

I know the movie theater will most likely distance people but its's not a highly ventilated area. On top of this, it sounds like she wants to have a sleepover. Her parents are okay with it but my mother is immunocompromised. I can't risk my mother's health or mine to hang out with my friend, as much as I want to have a sleepover with her. I treasure my friendship with this person to the point where I would put her wants in front of mine.

Don't want it anymore.Feel lame for posting what I feel like is just an attention seeking cry for help but I'm also feeling dangerously more depressed than usual and have no other outlet to go to. I've been suffering with depression, anxiety, and mental illness for the better part of 20 years. Have been on almost every antidepressant, anti-anxiety, anti-psychotic and mood stabilizing medication you can think of, and endless combinations of them mixed and matched together. None have helped. Have been hospitalized five times in my life for suicide attempts, twice in the past six months at a state mental hospital. Only made me feel worse. Been in professional therapy for just as long and it's a waste of time for everyone involved. I've been diagnosed with autism just recently at the age of 30 and have likely been struggling with it for years. I am consumed by stress, anger, and hatred, and am on the verge of being an alcoholic if I'm not one already. I'm in a large amount of debt and have a shitty unfulfilling job with no health insurance so my options are limited to cheap and often inefficient uncaring providers. I have no real friends and my very limited family understands nothing of mental illness and would only care if I was gone due to the inconveniences it would cause them.  I don't want it anymore. I feel like I don't truly want to get better. I don't enjoy life, and I'm tired of the constant uphill struggle for no reward. I didn't ask for any of this and I just want out.

Your hands, feet, and head are hanging  over the edges in little tight slots... and then the executioners pick up the other boat, lining it up... and suddenly, your body is stuck in a floating coffin. The boats line up perfectly, rim to rim, and your limbs are held in place by the tightly-fitting cuffs that the boats form. You think they're gonna make you starve to death. That would be mercy.

In my 24 years ive contributed absolutley nothing to anyone or done anything that brings value to anyone.

All my peers and collegues are amazing and moving up in the world, have careers, finished uni, have partners and are loving life and everyday im going downhill, failing university, not performing well at work and im my social life. Before when people used to ask me what i want to do in 5 years time, I responded with some optomistic bullshit where I would run my own business or some shit but now if anyone ask me, I cant even see past the next day let alone 5 years. I know I have amazing family, and I have a number of good friends and thats the only reason I keep getting up in the morning to try again. But if i was to describe myself i would say I am useless, worthless, unmotivated, lazy and a terrible person but most of all just downright pathetic. Looking at everything rationally im really lucky and privledged to have so many blessings and i feel so guilty like an overwhelming sense of guilt. I read though other peoples post and im amazed at how strong some people are. Im sorry that i cant be as strong as them.   Back in primary school im grade 5 people used beat me up, throw rocks and shit and a lot of other shit and i remember holding knife to my throat in the kitchen fuck i wish that i just ended it then.  Most days I think about how I should kill myself and how make it look an accident which has minimum disruption to my friends and family. I think ive worked out a way, and ive written a note and now I think im writing this out hoping for a sign to stay.

For the record it is psychosis, depression, general anxiety disorder, and autism.  The first time I tried to take my own life was while I was in grade school. That was when I was sent to the school counselor. They believed that it was just acting out due to by parents divorce. As far as the hallucinations, they just told me to stop lying. They felt I was smart for my age and was making a lot of this up.  I had another attempt when I was 13. I tried to overdose on sleeping pills. It didn't work and just made me really sick. So much so my dad took me to the doctor. I didn't admit what I had done so there was a lot of discussion of what it could be, but what got me to confess was when the doctor said they'd have to do exploratory surgery to find out what wrong. Looking back, I know now it was a ruse to get me to spill the beans.  That started my sessions in therapy and getting all these diagnosis. I was never put on any meds but learned to hide it and fake being normal. It was exhausting doing that and when I came home from school, I usually went straight to bed.  Now I am in my 30s and I am doing doctor visits again. When they started me on meds it felt like I could stop pretending and let my guard down. Only problem is the meds seem to work for a bit, then I start getting brain shivers, and I feel worse. They have never stopped the suicidal thoughts. Not a day goes by where I am not wishing I was dead or planning my demise.  The thoughts of wishing I was dead have turned to planning and figuring out ways to be successful. I am at the end of my rope. I can't take living like this anymore. It has left me friendless. I am a burden on everyone like my family, co-workers, and mostly my husband.

And that I'd be ""better off out of everyone's life."" He threatened to beat me up on multiple occasions because I got back together with my ex. Who was also his ex aswell. And she left him in the first place for being to possessive. And he told me he wanted to ""beat my a**""  just because I gave my ex a ride home from school. And he belives tgat now that he has her back as a girlfriend he can say this to me....you're probably thinking at this point that I'm just rambling about someone but bare with me...I was actually beginning to feel happy again prior to this night and all my suicidal thoughts from earlier in the year and years pass have finally subsided.

Thinking dark thoughts.Left mt condo to move cities so I can be with my 3-hour away LDR girlfriend of 2 years. After a few weeks, she says she's too busy for a relationship and needs it to just be FWB a few times a month. Two-years ago I rear-ended a guy when he slammed on his breaks for a pedestrian that jaywalked in front of him. Unknown to me, my liability insurance had been cancelled by my provider since I'd let my general membership fee lapse (it's for AMA, like a AAA membership but they do insurance too). They sent me a letter before they cancelled it stating that I needed to renew my membership or they'd cancel it. I did just that, but I called their general membership phone number and not the insurance number in the letter.  Talked to a lawyer and since my pink card had expired, nothing can be done about their mistake. The accident was a fairly low-speed collision, there was barely any damage to their car, but now they're seeking  about $50k in medical, lost wages, etc. I have piles of debt from school, and the only asset I have is a 1/3 share in the condo, split with my parents, with a mortgage that puts it basically underwater. And in Canada, once judgement is set against me, the Uninsured Motorists fund will cancel my driver's license, meaning I won't be able to get to work aside from a 1-2 hour bus ride there and then again back. And given I'm in inside sales set to go outside, if me license is cancelled I can't advance to a position where I'd be able to pay them back. Even if I declare bankruptcy, I'll never be able to drive until I pay off the debt, with interest. So now I'm alone, in a strange city with barely any friends, trying to learn at this new job, dealing with lawyers, knowing that I'm probably going to be majorly screwed by Christmas. 2013 looks set to be the year my life burns.

I got so many things out of the way as a teen and I'm glad i don't have to jump the hurdle as an adult.  I came out to my parents as trans a little over three years ago, and my dad just started to use my chosen name. Big step. I graduated high school, something i saw as a near unnatainable goal when i was a kid. I fell in love. Got hurt. Fell out of love. Learned the importance of loving yourself in a relationship, learned the importance of trust and loyalty. And now here I am, out of school, done with my teenage years, and moving on to a new chapter in my life. It's so strange to think when my mom was my age, I was born. My teen years weren't amazing. I lived in a low-to-middle-class family. We couldn't afford a lot. I wasn't always the best to my parents, but they always wanted the best for me, even if their methods made no fking sense at all sometimes. My advice to everyone younger than me: don't burn that bridge with your family. I almost did when i turned 18 and I'm glad i didn't. I've got a 2 year old brother and I'm very glad I'm going to be around to see him grow up. I won't miss my teenage years, but I'm so glad that i experienced them.

It's really about you enjoying life and feeling comfortable. A lot of that is self love as well. It's very hard to get out of your darkest times.

So much so that all I want to do is die. I had failed getting into university, and because of that I had to go to a community college. Funny thing is, I still managed to fail even that. I'm almost in my mid 20's and still mooch off of my parents. I've tried to get a job without much luck. Even when I did get a job I was usually fired within the first two months. I start to think that The only way for everyone around me to be completely happy, is to just kill myself. By then I won't be a problem for them. Everyone may be sad at first, but I know they'll eventually get over it and move on. They should be using the money meant for me, and use it on my younger siblings. That's the best option here I guess. No point in me focusing on making myself happy when all it does is inconvenience others. I know it all sounds so selfish and egotistical, but there's really no other way to fix things. It's either I succeed or they do, and at this point I'd rather see them succeed. The way I see it: what point would there be in me striving towards a goal that'll only destroy any chances for my younger siblings and my family to succeed? These thoughts have plagued me for so long that I can't remember a time when I actually experienced joy. It's all so painful to think about. Death is the only answer for me.

(I need 2 more stanzas with 4-6 lines each) [Stanza 1] Once upon a lofty journey, there was a pirate sick with scurvy. He led a crew of the poorest goons, for they had lost their gold and all thier doubloons. As the captain lay sleeping and slacking, he was awakened by creaking and cracking-- As his men entered his cabin, he assumed it was an attacker Until he heard ""Polly wants a cracker."" [Stanza 2] He saw his prized parrot perched proudly upon his private's shoulder and promptly fed the bird. Now that Polly had no hunger, the captain returned to his slumber and dreamt of something absurd. He imagined an island full of treasure and riches for him and his crew to gather. They filled their chests and britches and their pockets grew fatter and fatter. To the captain's displeasure, he awoke once more, to the familiar sound of fluttering feather. Then he heard, ""Polly wants a cracker."" [Stanza 3] He fed the bird again, hoping the interruptions would cease But then Polly squawked ""Give me one more piece!"" The pirate gave into the bird's command, hoping they would quickly find land-- For they were low on food and night time was coming soon. As the captain's eyes grew heavy and the sky became blacker  Once again he heard, ""Polly wants a cracker.""",0,suicide

3667,"The inevitableTwo major causes for issues right now. Written as two separate paragraphs. At about the age of 12 I felt that sinking feeling that I really was gay, and not just confused. Shortly after that I became a closeted proud gay teen waiting for the right time to come out. As time went on I began to feel more and more depressed and started cutting my arm. This whole time I was feeling further and further away from God, and not because I felt he abandoned me, but that I abandoned Him. I hadn't been to Church in 6 six years save for special holidays or funeral's. I got back into churchand started really praying and studying into what God was showing me on homosexuality. I had decided that the best way for me to honor the Lord was to pursue a celibate lifestyle. As time went on I got more involved within the body of Christ. Over the past few years things have gotten back to me desiring a family, but knowing that I could never marry a woman, and that I promised God I wouldn't partake in gay relationships. I am now 31 years old and realizing that I will grow old alone. Since I was in 7thbor 8th grade I was sent to see a shrink and my dad was told that I had ADHD and I was put on Adderall, Zoloft, Wellbutrin at different times....in school I always seemed to repel people and the few that could tolerate me I stuck like glue to until I pushed them away as well. I could never focus and take in what the teachers were talking about. I could however tell you all about Corvettes in minute details. Or exactly which TV shows were on which channel at what time for that week. Just recently I was made aware of the fact that I am likely on the Autism Spectrum rather than ADHD or just bring a weirdo like I thought I was. It feels like there are three options.  A) grow old alone being the gay ASD weirdo that annoys people (same as now but old) Die one day and be with God B) continue to fight the depression battle until one day I succumb to my own hand. Die and be separated from God. C) quit being celibate... hopefully obtain a partner... hopefully depression lightens...die one day and be separated from God *Not here for a religious debate.

I've tried to see a light at the end of the tunnel, but I can see nothing good about my life. It's almost unfair to ask me to endure this pain. I'm in such a hole and I have no way out. I'd move out of here, but I am broke. I'd get a job, but I have no ID. I can't even afford fucking bus fare. My GF is seeing someone else and my heart is broken. I've never in life imagined a person could hurt so deeply. Nobody really cares about me. I'm all alone and the only thing I can think of is how great it would be to not feel this way. And no amount of alcohol or drugs can fill that void. It'd be better to be dead. Christ, I can't even go out in public without wanting to cry and hide. I'm stuck in this foul house, with foul people and nothing to look forward to, except a non-stop montage of thinking about my ex, and the life that I lost. I'm crying so hard right now.

I get the feeling that this generation of teenagers like 2002-2008 has marked the beginning of something great. I remember my dad once told me when he was young he played lots and lots of football (soccer for the Americans here) and that they gathered groups of other dudes to play in fields and I thought to myself hey that's cool. But then he told me that he was about my age when they did that. I'm 17 and I thought to myself and said ""What do we do that's similar to older generations"" and I realized gaming had evolved so much that it can literally replace that kind of fun. Well, not as healthy but you get what I mean. Kids and teenagers gather and play for hours and hours just like the old times but it's different now and it's cool and I fucking love it because it's gonna evolve even more in the future.

Felt a weird calm and thought I'm ready, just kill me. I really thought I could die by letting voices or telling my brain to. I was hoping my brain would switch off or my heart would just stop. Nothing. No voices, first radio silence I've had in years. After years of hearing how they would kill me, there was nothing.   I woke up today and everything was back, worry, noise, constant talking.

3840,"Suicide hotline called the cops.I often feel very down and have suffered from suicidal thoughts for my entire life.  I was encouraged to call the suicide hotline if I ever I felt the need to talk to someone.  Well I did. And they called the cops!  But the cops couldn't find my house, so they dropped in on a few neighbors asking for me.  When the cops finally did find me and knocked on the door and I opened it, several neighbors were standing across the street watching the cops and EMS truck parked in my driveway.  The cops wanted my name and now I have a police file!  The cops said anyone could access this file if they wanted to get my story.  And that's that.  Now my neighbors are talking, there's a police record on me and I will never, ever, ever call a suicide hotline again, regardless of how I feel.  I'm not suggesting you don't call if you're really in danger, but if you're calling because you just need someone to talk to, don't be surprised if your life is really messed up afterwards when the police come to chat.   PS  At first I didn't want to give the cops my name, but when they threatened to put me in cuffs, arrest me and take me to the station, I told them who I was.  I live in a small town, the neighbors are really nosey, the local cops now know who I am, and so I am now thinking about moving because the shame I feel is tremendous.

About a year ago I realized that life is truly pointless, and that fact has been driving me crazy ever since. Some people say that it doesn't matter whether there's a purpose or not, but I disagree. Compared to plenty of other people I've had a good life, a great life even, but I'm ready for it to be over. I find myself considering suicide more and more lately and I've accepted that I'm going to do it. The problem is every time I get close to doing it one thing stops me, the thought of my deaths impact. My parents would be destroyed and my siblings as well. But specifically my younger brother, he's 13 and has had alot of problems in the past coping with stress and I fear my suicide is something he wouldn't be able to recover from. So here I am, 16 years old and the only thing keeping me alive is the guilt I feel. It's no way to live, I know that.

The first attempt was two years ago and the second one was two days ago. I've recently read that CO (carbon monoxide) is odorless and therefore not easily detectable and that in high concentrations it can kill you relatively painlessly within very few minutes, since you become unconscious fast after taking a few breaths and your body doesn't realize it is inhaling it instead of oxygen. So, does anyone know where I can find pure CO? I'd also like to know the amount I need to buy to do the job fast; I want it to end quickly and with as little agony as possible.

I know that I'll ride the limit as long as I have to, but I always have the thought in the back of my mind that maybe I am capable of going past it even though I feel like I can hold out just a little bit longer. It feels like the only thing holding me back nowadays is the idea of leaving my other half with my share of rent. We're still on a lease for 7 more months, that's a lot of money they don't have. Our parents (mine included, they have all the love in the world for them) would likely be able to help out until the lease is up, but I can't just off myself and also leave them with my share of rent because that ""likely"" wasn't a for sure yes. I dream of walking out of work, which would definitely help with what's overwhelming me, but what if I can't find work right away? Still leaving them with my share of rent. It just feels so unfair to be so miserable and in such a dark, toxic place while I struggle to better myself though. So do I leave them with rent, but set them free to find something and someone who is actually going to move them forward in life? Or do I hold out and slowly wear them out when they deserve so, so, so much more than I am anywhere near able to provide just to make sure they can afford rent? I know there's love, there's support, there's everything positive provided by my other half and I hate knowing I'm this dark cloud that they're accepting as if it's not eating away at them day by day. I know they're tired, I know they're fighting off the realization that I'm not what they thought I was, I know that they're justifying my dark demons to remain positive about the situation. They deserve more. I want them to have more. I don't know what to do, but I want to do the right thing.

3857,Getting HelpLived with depression and anxiety most of my life. Self treated with alcohol until 10 years ago and been on antidepressants since then. My doctor says I must see a counselor or she will not continue to prescribe meds. So I go to a counselor and he starts off with telling me he will call the authorities if I admit to suicide thoughts or harming anyone else. I dont really like the guy so I find another counselor. She tells me the same thing in a more tactful way. My point is this: how do I get help with my feelings if I cant talk to the counselor without fear of being reported or locked up? I wouldn't bother with drugs and counselors if I had completely decided to end my life. They are so busy stating disclaimers to see they just undermined the whole purpose. So the choice is to give up on healthcare and go my own way or suffer through useless counseling sessions while hiding the truth? Seems about as pointless as everything else.,1,suicide

3872,"here is my plan, how can i improve itThe only way you can guarantee organ donation is being braindead or being close to a hospital when you die. id liquidate everything i had that was worth something, donate the rest. get into a nice squabble with my parents so i could ""move out"" and get rid of all my shit. bring the car to a expensive car wash place, empty it out and get it cleaned. then id go out and buy a nice suit and brand new shoes. id put the dry cleaned suit and new shoes in the car so they'd be ready. then id go to a funeral home and see how much a funeral costs, leave that amount in the car too. if any money was left over, id donate it to a charity. after that, drive to St-Mary's hospital and park in the back right behind the urgence sante garage. From there, phone the security desk or triage and make them aware of what I was about to do and that i wanted to donate my organs. Then I would turn on my hazards and tie down the steering wheel so the horn is blaring. i would tie a thick black plastic bag over my head so some kid walking by doesn't get ptsd by watching me kill myself. then I would use a flare gun with a 22LR conversion kit (metal piece that adapts from flares to 22LR) to shoot myself in the head from inside my mouth. the 22LR has just enought power to break through your skull but not enought to come out the other end, so no danger to anyone else. if you hold it to your temple you can miss and fuck up your corneas for donation. that way 1) family doesnt have to go through my shit 2) i have whatever is necessary to be buried 3) im legit 20 meters away from the emergency room and have a high chance of being able to donate all my organs to someone else who actually wants to live",1,suicide

3889,"crashingIt's getting to the point where I can't hold it together anymore. I've been 'high functioning' for years but it's all becoming too much. The only reason I've lived as long as I have is because I don't want to hurt my loved ones, but it's getting to the point where I cant even take care of myself anymore. I've become an adult infant, my brain is so fucked up. Sure, I'm really lucky to have people who love me, but it honestly makes me feel shittier in the long run for feeling as miserable as I do. I've been really good at putting on a mask for so long but it's all starting to crumble. My only motivation to get better at this point is honestly so I can get to a point where I have enough freedom to make my death look like an accident. I don't want anyone to think there was anything they could have done to save me. I just want to spend the last of my time making everyone feel loved and special. I want to donate all of my things to those in need and create an inspiring story of travel and healing and helping others and gathering as community. I don't want my death to be traumatic for others. I want their hearts to be full of happy memories, I want them to feel loved and cared for. I am just so tired of being confined to this physical body.  I am so tired of hurting so badly. I feel defected. Maybe it's all of the trauma maybe it's all of the drugs I've done to cope with it or maybe it just is what it is.  I feel completely drained and deteriorated. I don't know how to keep going anymore. I can't even think about work without having a panic attack. The physical symptoms of anxiety are causing me to basically be bedridden.

Slowly everything became distant.  She still tried to hang out with me but she wouldn't engage in conversations anymore or even try.  It was like she was uninterested in me.  I think I made her believe that she wasn't important to me. We had a text argument about this whole situation and she believes that ""we were meant for different paths."" and said her goodbye.  It never made sense to me because she chose to go on the different path rather than tell me how she feel.  It broke me.  I don't know what to do with my life anymore.  I have no friends.

3894,"Am I really suicidal if I'm afraid to die?Hi. I'm pathetic. I've had suicidal thoughts for almost a decade now. I've tried the works- therapy, medication, mediation, fitness, burying myself in hobbies, socializing. I've also attempted suicide before, but it was half-assed and unsurprisingly failed. So I'm still here, feeling like this. And whenever I try to talk about how I feel with the people I trust in my life, they never seem to take me seriously. I think that they acknowledge my mental illness(es), but they truly don't believe that I'll ever commit suicide. And maybe they're right. I haven't been able to in the past. And I suppose the thought of death still scares me when it comes down to it. Does that mean I don't really want to die?  Because I hate being alive. I feel disgusting. I feel like the future is so bleak, and the thought of continuing on like this for years and years to come is suffocating. Like swimming through a sea of tar. I made a noose and sat there with it around my neck and I just couldn't do it. And now I'm sitting here feeling so defeated and pathetic. Why am I like this? Too fucking weak to fucking try harder to have a better life, but also don't have the courage to just end it.  I'm terrified that I've become one of those people who cry suicide but have no intention to follow through. I hate people who act as though suicide is a threat. I've always felt they made a mockery of mental health and detracted from the experiences of those who truly suffered. Is that what I am? Because as much as I'm afraid of dying, the idea of death fills me with such a sense of peace. So why am I so fucking scared?",1,suicide

3948,"Reaching the peak.Hello there redditors! I am not used to using reddit, so if i make some mistakes that are against the general code of conduct i am sorry. The reason i am writing here today is: My whole life people hated me, i was never a mean guy, never made problems and am pretty centered on my goals. Today it hit me. I was sitting on a bench with my friend and out of nowhere a guy comes and starts insulting me and my friend. I didn't say anything because i was afraid that i would get attacked or something. My whole life i never stood up for myself, probably because of an absence of a male figure in my life. I am reaching my limit, one day , soon , i will buy an AK-47 or an AR-15 and go an a spree. I WISH NOT TO DO THIS AND FEEL LIKE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE WILL STOP MAKING PROBLEMS FOR NO REASON.

3988,"I Wish I Could Do ItI like subheadings so I'm gonna break this down piece by piece. Context: I graduated college in December. Now I'm working a low level customer service job again. This job is at a company that I've worked at before, but not this exact store. I don't know anyone there, and I'm put in a low level power of authority (like a shift manager). No one there really likes me very much, and I have a bad habit of being mean when I feel threatened. Diagnosis: I've been in and out of therapy for about 7 years, and I take medication. Officially I have severe depression, anxiety, and paranoid episodes. Work life: Basically, right now I'm not doing what I want to do at all. I'm stuck doing a job I hate, with people I don't care for, and making shit money. I've already tried applying for ""real jobs"" but it just isn't working because I do not have enough experience or a strong enough portfolio. My work environment is toxic, and I can already feel it driving me insane. Dating life: I can't get a date. I have tried almost every dating app, and still no luck. Of course I've tried in person too, and it just doesn't happen. I've had horrible luck with women. For example, a girl I dated dumped me and then fucked my roommate behind my back. I think most women don't want to be around me because my life is so stressful at times. I try not to let it get to me, but as I'm sure we all know there is a breaking point. Family life: I guess in the grand scheme of things I have a ""loving"" family. My parents are still married, and they try to support me and do their best. However. my mom is constantly on my ass about how I should be trying to move out, pay more of my bills, take on responsibility, etc. I am the oldest and I have younger siblings who would be devastated if anything happened to me. However, in spite of everything I just feel so worn down, defeated, and depressed. Sometimes I wish I could just do it, and end this miserable existence of mine. I'm in bed right now, I'm not feeling actively suicidal but I definitely do not want to be alive. I'd love some advice, thoughts, or whatever you have, if you don't mind.

4015,"Is there more to life?Day in and day out I'll go to work, acquiring funds and then buying unnecessary garbage and services just to justify my suffering at that said job. At my age, I'm too old to switch careers so I'm stuck in this soul crushing industry. I find no sense of achievement nor joy nor find any kind of emotional support to tide me through the day.  So, what's next? Have a family of my own even though love is so fleeting? I've been through many years of long term relationships. Being cheated on once has taught me that all those years of love and attention will revert to dust once she's tired of you. Should I ride the roller coaster of love? To ride it again and again like madmen expecting different results? I have a negative outlook about marriage for I don't have any good examples to look up to. For example, my father has three families and is currently doting on his new family. Or, I should follow my dreams.. I wish I had though. I envy those who have dreams or have discovered their talents, for I have none. Everyday is just the bland rat race for scarce resources. Nothing that has meaning, everything just useless constructs. I could devote myself to a hobby, but that's just me distracting myself. Maybe it's better to be drunk and lead a hedonistic life than be sober about life. Sorry for this long rant, I just don't see anything more to life.  It's like life is just an unending cycle of production and consumption. Thanks for listening. EDIT: It's been 12 days and I haven't found any credible argument to continue this life. So it's either I delude myself until I get old and outlive my usefulness in this capitalistic dog eats dog society, or I can at least grant myself my only remaining freedom: the freedom to kill myself in order to choose when and where I'd die.

Just like normal dark hallways and zombies and stuff.

My main question is is this normal, or am I just being really edgy? I don't know about edgy, because this is something I cannot control and just keeps happening off and on, but please let me know if it is. On my last post, some pretty awesome people (that's a MASSIVE understatement) helped me out a little bit by telling me to go to a therapist and such, but I don't really know about that My main fear about someone finding this out is my parents. I don't want them thinking I'm a troubled kid, or that I need extra protection, or that I'm simply and plain a scaredy cat.

My younger brother(3-4 year old) and I(a 7-8 year old) wanted to prank my older brother because children are little gremlins.  Our plan was simple: Sneak in while he was at school, cut open his pillow, put shaving cream in it, and skedaddle. But when we opened the pillow, the shaving cream had Aloe Vera in it, which I'm highly allergic to. I try to back out, but my little bro convinced me to do it.  The plan went well, until that night when my and my bros had to be painted, and we had to crash in my older brother's room. He reported later on that he felt his pillows be a bit squishy, but was only weirded out. The day after, I go to school, my little brother and I not have telling anyone about the shaving cream prank. Now, being allergic to a medical herb, you train yourself to determine what's a bug bite, and what's not. And when I saw hives, I immediately went to the nurse, asking to see my Mom. The nurse just handwaved it, saying it was a bug bite, and sent me back Big mistake As the quarter hour passes, my body starts swelling everywhere, hives growing and clustering, then lapping over each other. The teacher sends me back to the nurse looking like something from Silent Hill(fitting, because of the game's themes), and calling my Mom to come pick me up, saying, ""You're child looks like a monster"" My mom and I get to the ER, and the receptionist takes one look at me, and gets me to get an EpiPen. For those without allergies, you lucky ducks, they're essentially a thing you take when you have a severe allergic reaction, and Benadryl can't stop it.

When I have a particularly bad stretch like I have in the last few months, I feel a fluctuating but ever present level of crappy all day every day.  On bad days I feel really awful and even simple tasks are difficult.  Even sleeping is hard so even that doesn't give me an escape.  I do have a therapist who is wonderful. I don't have clinical depression.  The sad thing is that when I am physically well I am a joyful person.  I am married to a beautiful and supportive man I want to spend decades with.  I work from home a little bit as an artist when I'm well enough, and absolutely love my work.  I find simple beauty in so many places, in so many people.  I truly do my best to access as much of life as I can despite my illness.  But I feel shitty so often.  I can't imagine suffering like this for 40-50 more years.  Sometimes I feel like even though I don't want to kill myself, suicide is going to be my only option because there's a limit to how much of this I can take.  I have been thinking about suicide more often lately because it almost relieves a little bit of psychic tension to remember that there is a possible escape from this.  Sometimes I take an Ativan just for some relief from the mental angst that comes with all of it, or to sleep peacefully for a little while. I'm scared and mentally fatigued and I wish I could just get a break from my body.  Is it even irrational to kill yourself if you are suffering physically and it's out of your control?

I don't see why suicide would be a bad thing (in my case).In a shitty college with shitty people and I don't have the motivation to make myself feel better by joining clubs and finding new people.  I am on antidepressants and I am seeing a counselor.  I'd like to have a discussion about why killing myself would be so bad, starting with family. I haven't been close to my sister for over 10 years.  She'll post on my facebook wall intermittently, but that's about it.  The last time I saw my biological mother was when I was in 1st grade (I'm 23 now).  She'll be okay.  I have two stepbrothers, but we aren't very close either.  My stepmom is great, but we aren't close.  My Dad has always been ""there"" and singlehandedly raised my sister in a foreign country (the US) with little money while studying full time for a JD.  He loves me, but I couldn't care less how sad I'd make him feel. However, family isn't the biggest issue.  I only keep some contact with my best friends from high school.  The friends that I have in my current school have either also moved on (I'm going to be a super senior), or have weird quirks that keep me from being able to develop any deep friendships with them. I am fully aware of what I have accomplished and I have accomplished some good things, but that is irrelevant given that I'm feeling shitty about my social life. I guess right now I'm more confused about why I feel so rejected and lonely.  I just get the sense that the world would lose nothing if I ordered from cyanide pills and died tomorrow.  I'd definitely make some people sad, but they'll move on and that'll be that.  What would be so bad? Really, I am listening.",1,suicide

There's more to it, but the title is a lot of it. I'm just so fucking lonely and can't figure out what to do about it.  I know this whole subject is a big joke, because of the movie, 40 year old virgin, and the whole ""forever alone"" thing on reddit, but for me it's not a joke. It's been a misery my whole life. If only it could be as simple as the thing in the movie. In my case, there was some bad shit that happened when I was a kid that I don't want to get into, but anyway, it's complicated.  Sometimes I'm almost OK with it. I occupy myself with other things. Then for some reason I want it again and I completely suck at dating. Furthermore, I have a deal now where I only want women who are plainly too young for me. I see women my own age and they look like old women. Maybe that makes me a bad person, but I can't help it, that's how it is. I go on dating sites and see them and just say fuck it, I can't go there. Also I don't just want to get laid. I would love to have a girlfriend. I've had a few younger women who acted for a while like they might be interested in that way, but it never went anywhere. Either they thought better of it, were just messing with me for fun, or I read things into it that might not have been there.  I have this idea in the back of my mind that one day I will find a prostitute that I'm attracted to, get what sex I can till I max out my credit card, then kill myself. I don't know if I will actually do it, because I think of the people who care about me that I would hurt, but dammit they all fucking have someone and I don't. Or they at least have had someone.

4249,"the anonymity of suicideI met the son of a woman who killed herself recently. She stepped in front of a train. It was caught on tape at the station. My mother is a legal consultant so the son is suing and trying to get the train platform fixed to be more safe...       I found it really strange to see how the son reacted. He was devastated I'm sure but he didn't show much of it. To someone like me and my mom this woman's suicide... was abstract and anonymous. Anyone who he could tell the story to would probably feel sympathy but the anonymity of it means that there is a disconnect there.   I often fantasize about suicide and its become more real to me recently. My belief system is falling out of place and my career path is failing me---for me it was more than a career path, it was a purpose. So without any beliefs and any purpose I really feel lost and confused. I had a god awful childhood and really worked hard to strive for a sense of stability and normalcy but I'm not sure why it matters. So much was ruined and I can hardly even think of anything in my past that wasn't horrific. Now that the present is growing to be more and more stressful, with no future peace in sight, I can't think of a reason to not give up. So after hearing the story of this woman who killed herself who left her son behind (no other family members), I wonder about the significance of suicide and how I guess it seemed so simple and affected so few people. The fact that the world goes on without you is a sort of sad thing... like for instance, if I killed myself, no one would care after long and I'd be forgotten. The actual part about being forgotten doesn't bother me... what it translates to---the fact that it proves how little I matter, is what bothers me. It makes me wonder about my importance in the world and how little it would matter after just a few days. Some people would remember me but eventually they would forget. What difference does any one person make in the world?",1,suicide

But here I am. During high school I had a relationship that gave me hope. We were going to leave everything behind move to the US and start our lives together (we both live in Mexico). He was the love of my life, we were both on the verge but together we found a reason to live a reason to try. He didn't stay that way. He changed started turning into his father who he despised I wound up in a mental hospital we tried to save our dream but it was too late. Everything was too fucked up. In a way for me the love of my life died he no longer exists. Ive tried to replace him in the sense of finding a reason to live be it another partner be it anything and I keep fucking failing. I am unlovable, I am disgusting. And I don't mean physically, Ive been told Im attractive, Im signed to a modeling agency.

Girls are threatened by you so they treat you like shit and boys want you as their fuck toy. I had found someone that really loved all of me but he isn't here anymore. I like this boy right now and I wish we could be less alone together but when he looks at me he only sees a pretty face, someone he hooked up with. He's too scared of someone like me hurting him.

And obviously i love her, so i broke up with her so she doesnt have to deal with that mental pain of me always wanting to suicide. She wont understand that i did that till i die, and by then it will be too late. Even for my parents, depression is a joke, till they see my dead body being dropped beneath the ground.

They wont ever connect the dots of the actions you do, the small cries of help that you force out, until after your gone. What a fucked up system of a world we live in",1,suicide

Why am I like this? Why do I still feel that desire to cut when everything is going perfect. What's wrong with me? I feel like there's a ghost in my head telling me how I would be so much better at the bottom of the bridge. Am I the only one who feels like this? Why am I like this?",1,suicide

I brought two children into this world with my wife, but we have no family support. I have a very large life insurance policy on myself, which pays out on as long as my death is not deemed intentional. A car accident should suffice and if I decide to move forward with this action I will simply place this laptop into the bin, with this throw away account there should be no actionable information. I'm tired. I tried very hard, we have no family but two children. The job pay is capped and despite my optimism that starting a company might turn into something. I think I have failed and a large lump sum will set everyone up for a much better life than what I could earn for them. What possible advice am I asking?

If I do kill myself, I'll be leaving a mess for someone else to clean up. That's so fucking shitty.

I don't want anyone to have to go through all of the crap in my room. That's the fucked up reason I never really deep clean my room 100%. That last mess is what's keeping me alive because I can't think about my mom or my brother or anyone going through that mess. People say suicide is selfish and thinking about suicide is selfish but really so many of us are just thinking about what will be better for those around us. Will it be better for me to stay here burdening you, or for you to have to clean up my mess but then not have to deal with me again? Either way, we all lose don't we?  It's not that I don't want to live, it's that I feel like I can't. It's as if there is some dark chain holding me back from accomplishing even the most minor tasks.

My family and ""friends"" might give a shit for a couple weeks, but I know for a fact that they'll move on and be ok after the initial grief spell. So why do people say this so much? Isn't their desire to see me alive selfish in and of itself? I'm not trying to be edgy or whatever, I just legitimately don't understand.  I actively try and hide the fact that I want to kill myself, so I really don't care about attention or any of the other shit people threaten suicide for. I have friends, I have a good relationship with my family, and the ones I've told have helped me out more than I could ever ask for. However, things don't work out the way I ever want them to and I always end up in the same spot like I am now, drunk and alone on a Sunday afternoon.  Anyway, why is suicide selfish? It seems to me like the best thing I can do for myself at this point in my life, and I don't understand why everyone tells me they'll miss me and it's a bad idea blah blah fucking blah.

The start of a new year, what felt to be my best year yet. I worked a year to buy a car, turning 18 in March. Oh if I knew what was coming. The one thing I had always loved was cars, and I was finally so happy to get my own. February, I get my first girlfriend. Things seem great, right Ryan? No. I didn't know what I was getting into. My girlfriend left me on the day I graduated high school, no reason given - walked out blocked me without a trace. I knew it. I should've known better. I've already been hurt so much before why did I even try to give effort to someone else. 3 days later, I was kicked out. Parents were done with me. I'm living in my car, my last sense of security and hope. All I care about, I put so much of an emotional investment into it, what a mistake I made. June 27th, 10:02 PM. It happened. The last thing keeping me together was taken, my car, totaled, landing myself in the hospital for the night. Crying, lost, feeling helpless. My parents chose to take me back in. It wasn't the same anymore. All it was for me is blame. ""It's your fault everything happened"" ""it's your fault that you're a failure."" Permanently injured from the accident, nowhere to turn, no car, family just dragging me down telling me to do better. All I hear now is bad, arguing, and that I'm the let down of the family. Well, if I'm the let down, I guess this is it. I don't know what to do anymore. I lost everything I cared for and about. I lost my path. I lost my friends to COVID - guess they weren't really who I thought they were. Lost my family - kicked out again as of tonight, nothing to get me by. I don't know what to do anymore.

I was raised by my parents to be a kind,respectful and helpful person (sorry for the swearing). I got bullied so fucking hard in the first year of highschool, I started to hate myself. My parents got divorced when I was 7 and I stay with my mother. We were happy together but school was really making me uncomfortable and she knew that. Then, she married a man a year ago. I met him six months before marriage and he was kind and respectful to me until the marriage. After they married, he started to humiliate me almost every fucking day. He doesn't harm me in any physical way, but I'm just an emotional man and I take what's said so seriously and he knows it. I have talked to my mother several times and she doesn't seem to care at all. This fucking man has a son that is two years younger than me, he is so dirty, unrespectful, rude,any negative adjectives you can think of. And guess what, we dislike each other to the hell. This fucker humiliates me as well, but when I try to say something, my mother interrupts so that I wouldn't say anything. I used to talk these to my elder brother, but he lives in another city and he can't come very often.  In school, nothing really changed. I am now in a different class with relatively normal people, but I feel like I am not loved or wanted all the time. I feel like people take advantage of me. I feel like people I see as friends are disgusted of me. I have been lonely for my entire life.

Not once, not twice, but so many many many many times over the last 2 years. I have caused them so much emotional pain and misery, and quite possibly scarred them mentally for life. I dont deserve to live anymore. Ive always had suicidal thoughts, and attempted quite a few times (although 3-4 times is when i intended to carry out but failed due to stupid mistakes). I really love this person, but i hurt them a lot. I cant keep doing this. I keep regretting every decision i made and it affects me negativity to the point of making another mistake and hurting them. Then, back to regret and so on. Its the shitty cycle of regret and bad coping. I want to go through with killing myself tomorrow, away from friend and family. I cant do this anymore. This guilt is eating my alive and is making me more horrible and ugly on the inside. I wish i can turn back time and fix everything, but thats the wish we all want, isnt it.  I hurt the love of my life. I hurt my family. I hurt my friends and stopped talking to them. I am done with hurting people. I cry almost everyday and its getting harder to breath. Im old enough to know whats right and whats wrong, but i am too stupid to realize it. I act like a baby and rely on people too much. I cant handle one single responsibility to any group project members or family. To you im just another person whos writing here to vent or to just say a few last words knowing theyre heard before they go away for good. Thats completely fine and thats exactly what i expect. I am really sorry to have put all the people in my life through this, especially the love my life which saw truly the ugliest sides of me.

He raised me and took care of me until April 2014 when him and my mom got a divorce.  About 6 months later, mom revealed to me that he wasn't my real dad and my real dad was some schmuck in Elwood, Indiana. Now, dad completely forbade this before he left because of reasons I'm not too sure of, but if I was told this before he thought I was ready he'd kick both me and mom out of the house.  Fast forward to present day. I'm informed about a week and a half ago that my, what we called ""sperm donor"", died. It didn't affect me any because I didn't know him, as he denied any and all requests for us to meet. My mom starts reading his obituary and finds out that I have a sister. This is a shock to me. I thought it was just me and her after dad left and my grandpa died. Mom and my sister, let's call her Sheryl, talked for a bit last night. And we agreed to meet today after work and before class (a span of 2 hours).  She's super nice and we hit it off immediately. It's a relief to know that it's not just me and mom anymore.

I can't physically be there for her. I'm several towns over and have serious work obligations until the weekend.  I'm angry at her brother. Angry that he would put his family through something like this. They don't deserve this kind of pain. But I can't tell my girlfriend this because she clearly has enough on her plate as it is. To add insult to injury,  they lost a family member last week - her grandfather. And for her brother to turn around and do this. I'm just furious. He's never been known to be suicidal in the years that I've known this family.  When Robin Williams (R.I.P.) hung himself I was angered because I wondered why he'd put his family through that kind of pain. A friend helped me understand that suicide isn't a cowards move. It's a heavy choice. And if somebody decides to end their life, we should respect that choice at the very least and understand they're not trying to put others in pain. And I believed that until now. I just absolutely cannot understood why he (gf's brother) would do this. I don't know what to do. I love this girl, but I'm powerless to help her.  ",1,suicide

That was three years ago though and I don't see it happening again. I was too scared to leave the house today.both my roommates left for the weekend. I haven't been to the gym in months. Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and I think I'm handsome guy. Last year I thought I was gay for a little bit but I think that's because I was just so lonely. I start talking to a guy on grinder but then when he asked to meet I got nervous and deleted the app. Sometimes I look at gay porn but not very often. I don't think my roommates would understand. My sister tried to kill her self a couple months ago. She's turning 27 next month. She lives with my mom and quit her job right after she tried to kill her self. She just got a job at Walmart two weeks ago and recently quit. My mom has to go with her to her doctors appointments. I haven't seen my dad in three years. I should call him more often. I have talk to him one time since Christmas and it did not talk to him on Christmas. I dropped out of high school and have very bad handwriting. I'm really self-conscious about it. When I was 18 years old I weighed almost 400 poundsmy mom bought me a treadmill and I ran on it every day. I stopped writing this note to order a pizza there's something funny about that. It's not a matter if I'm going to kill myself but when. My mom and sister are extremely overweight and one of them as suicidal tendencies. I'll probably do it after they die. I see three possibilities for my life. 1. I meet a girl (or guy) who'll sleep with me have a couple of kids be broke for the rest of my life kids grow to resent me I've become an alcoholic.this is the least likely and happiest choice. 2. I Stay employed to the job I don't like get an apartment by myself and basically do what I'm doing tonight for the rest of my life: become a shut in who doesn't talk to people in orders delivery food with social Security money. 3.

4563,"Kind of at my wits end hereWelp. I'm not really sure where to begin. I am a 30 year old living in America. I grew up on the coast. I still have both my parents although they've never been together. My brother and I do not speak often or candidly. 4 years ago I left everyone and everything I knew for a job I knew I didn't want. Running didn't help. I'm more boring now than I ever have been. I was popular in high school and made strong connections in college. I fucked up my studies thoroughly and never finished. Haven't spoken to a single person from college since. I've never had sex. I've only looked at porn a few times and it made me anxious. I do occasionally masturbate but I have a unique fetish that is harmless but brutally embarrassing. I have no idea how I ""got it."" Been this way since puberty. Not well-endowed either so I have never even tried to get laid and try to make it work. On top of this, I have a body I've ruined through extremely rapid weight gain and intense alcohol abuse. I was very handsome even just a few years ago, it's crazy how things can spiral. Lying here in my bed, going on 6 months of therapy, and my 3rd day sober, my biggest streak in many years. All I can think about is how much I've wasted and how lost I am. I don't mean to spin a sob story, but I've said more here than I have in therapy. I don't feel like I will ever ""catch up"" to the rest of you all and I doubt I will make it to 40. I think something must have happened to me when I was young or maybe I was born with crossed wires. Either way, I am at least grateful to live with the internet, even if nobody reads this.",1,suicide
4564,"Ready to let goI got engaged in August, so I should be happy and celebrating all that...but a week afterwards, I somehow get into a devastating car wreck while in an Uber. I was rushed to the ER and was lucky to get out with only minor cuts that have since become scars. But for what it's worth, I shouldn't be alive. Neither should the driver or my friend who was the other passenger in the ride. We all cheated death, and it has weighed heavily on me along with the pressure from parties trying to collect money from me for medical services while I try to reach an insurance settlement with Uber and the guy who rear-ended us. I got out of a terrible job situation in June after MONTHS of searching for something better...and then I abruptly got laid off in September. I felt secure enough to use my investments to pay off most of my credit card debt that I amassed after leaving a different awful job situation. Because of all this, my savings are minimal and I hardly have enough to make it through November. With the clock counting down and nobody requesting job interviews, my self-worth is in free fall and a deep depression has swallowed me as I approach the worst-case scenario. Every time something good happens to me, something else takes away that joy tenfold. This has been the pattern of my life since I was young.  I am not meant to be happy.  I am not meant to be here. The only thread holding me to life is the fear I'll survive an attempt or I won't die right away and experience an even worse pain and agony.",1,suicide

I just started thinking about it again a couple of weeks ago, and last night I was really sure I wanted to go through with it. I still am.  I had hope three years ago - the last time I attempted -  when I started on medication and got a therapist and I thought, maybe it really will end. But it hasn't. I've had some ups, but mostly downs, and now that college is coming and no university will accept me because of this stupid disease, I realize that I can never escape depression. Unless I die.  I can't tell my counselor. The words don't come out. I feel like I'm just attention-seeking. I've felt numb since last night. My limbs are heavy, and I'm resigned to the fact that I am going to die. You can't get guns here though, which means I'll have to do it a messy way. Probably by slitting my wrists or ODing, but maybe I could manage to jump in front of a bus or something. I don't know.

I've struggled with depression since second grade, but I know reality when I see it, and for once reality looks even grimmer than what's in my head. Long story short, if I do anything, she's already accomplished it and done it twenty times better than I did. I used to be valedictorian, until she came along--and now she's shoved me down into the middle of our class. I was elected to a secretary position for a student organization, and suddenly she, in her presidential position, took over all of my jobs and won't even let me do anything; everyone is constantly fawning over her and how much she does and then they look at me with disdain as if to say, 'what are you doing, you worthless slug? Get off your ass and help her!'. I tried to make it into NHS this year, and not only was I the only one of my friends without a form filled out to the very edges with activities and merit, but mine was only about half-full. She filled two. I'm a journalist for Model UN, but she's the Vice President. I wouldn't even be upset if she wasn't a bossy, whiny, spoiled bitch. I wouldn't be upset if everyone actually had a logical view on her instead of adoring her blindly just because puberty has done her well. It's gotten to a point where I'm just done. I'm well aware that I'm a failure, and for some reason the world just sees fit to rub it in my face. I'm done living in it. I have no hope for a career and no plausible future. No one would even notice if I just didn't show up at school one day. I doubt they'd even remember I existed long enough to come to my funeral.

Like right now, I feel so much despair I figure I'll decide to end it someday. I feel like my life is meaningless as a virgin. Tomorrow I might feel better, but this is a recurring problem for me. I feel so sad. I feel like if I killed myself I might finally get attention and validation through my death. The only meaning of life that makes sense to me in this moment is having sex with as many people as possible. I feel lonely and crave validation so I don't feel like crap. It is as if I need a constant chorus of sincere praise. I've been to psychologists, social workers, but they do not know what the hell they are doing when it comes to issues of sexuality. They have no fucking clue how to deal with losers like me who have never even been kissed. They have no fucking training in it. I feel like there is something wrong with me. I feel like my mother does not accept me for who I am. I am very very envious of people who have had sex, who have always had abundance with the opposite sex, who talks as if it is no big deal when they CLEARLY ALWAYS TOOK IT FOR GRANTED. I hate it when people are open and brag about their sexuality. I don't know what to do. Maybe I'll kill myself someday. Maybe then people will believe that virginity is something that can cause depression. Maybe then people wouldn't invalidate my experiences ""Oh, sex is not everything,"" etc etc. Maybe I would finally, in death, get the validation that I crave. I don't think I'm going to kill myself anytime soon, but someday, if things don't change, it could happen several years from now.",1,suicide
4622,"I'm tired of being ok with things I'm not ok with It's almost been 2 years since I've realized that people who are around me are only there when they need me and after I helped them they will throw me in the scraps. I've always been the type of person who wholeheartedly help people when they need something but everyday no one made me feel like I'm relevant. Everyday is a survival game that I play. I play by their rules and I'm their disposable character. Each day is a challenge to get by and I'm always by myself. No one made me feel important or even give me a single sense of compassion. I've always wonder how did I survived all these years.  The only control that I have in my life is my own death and yes, everyday I always think of how I can kill myself quietly and not in a painful way because that's maybe the only time that I'm not gonna feel any pain. I'm exhausted of loving, caring ang giving too much to the world that only gives me misery and agony. My mind is being tortured everyday and I ask myself why me? Why do I have to experience these things at the age of 17? For every single day of my life I was hoping that things will get better in time that soon I'll be happy but that's just a false hope, nothings changed even if I try harder.  I gave up everything for the happiness of my parents, friends(?), and everyone. My dreams were always decided by my parents, in an instant it was decided that I'm gonna be an engineer, all those  plans and dreams melted away. These people had never been kind to me and have always invalidated what I feel because they selfishly use me as their investment in life. Why do I have to do thibgs for other people? When can i do a single thing that will make me happy? Nothing keeps me sane anymore. I just want my suffering to end. One of these days, I'm gonna snapped and kill myself hahahha.

I go through the same routine every night. I think about how much of a failure I am. I was praised as a ""smart"" child. I grew up thinking that I was destined to be something great. High school came and went in the blink of an eye. My grades very poor. I couldn't find a reason to do well. ""High school is dumb, college is where it matters"". Here I am in college, I haven't gone to class in 4 weeks because I can't find the motivation. My mother is the unforgiving type. ""You only do poorly in school because of the damn computer"" Maybe it isn't my overbearing feelings of self worthlessness and wanting to kill myself. Maybe it is the only escape I have left in this dull world that is pulling me down. At least it isn't a heroin addiction like my brother, right? Maybe I will work at a fast food chain for the rest of my life like she said I would. The semester is almost over. I fear what my mother will do when she sees I failed all my classes. Maybe when she said ""community college doesn't matter"" I shouldn't have taken it literally. I don't know what awaits for my future. College makes me want to kill myself. The boring lectures, the professors who ask for requirements that I have no idea what they mean. It only adds on to my list for reasons to die than to live. I know they're temporary, I know the solution is permanent, but I don't care. I just don't care anymore. I recently had to leave my old job due to circumstances that I caused by accident. I'm struggling to find a new one. I need a purpose in my life. It's one of the few things that keeps me going. All I do is sleep and go on the computer. The only things that keep me alive at this point are my father and my friends. I'm insignificant as a human.

4661,"Dog President Below is my comedy featuring a dog that is for a grade.  Dog president. You heard me right. Dog. President. President that is a dog. President with a color spectrum of just blue and yellow. He sees 17.6% of his own flag. He can't be racist if he can't see colors. He can't even say slurs, for he is a dog. The bestest boy in the Oval Office.  President President (his legal last name) had a rough campaign to get where he is now. Dog President was a seasoned military veteran before presidency. He has served eight tours to Iraq, each one more dangerous than the last. Dog President has accumulated more than 4,000 kills. He received a medal of honor for his contributions to world peace. He was retroactively given sole responsibility for the death of Osama Bin Laden, for the Pentagon found it too embarrassing to release the killer of the most feared organization at the time to be a dog. It's worth noting that kill was purely out of duty to his country, not because Dog President is discriminatory to any races. Dog President even brought back a bone from that mission, though it is unclear where the bone came from.  After his war efforts, he got right to volunteer work. Dog President spent most of his time collecting trash at his local dog park. When he noticed the public response to his selflessness, he decided to run for governor. Yes, he skipped mayor. His policies went toward nature conservation and a harsh stance on animal cruelty. The lucky mutt got in by a landslide. In the dog days of summer, he even participated in his volunteer work as he did before politics.  With a last name of President, Dog aimed for the highest position there was. The campaign was smooth sailing until he publicly marked his territory at a debate. That scandal caused much uproar, but he soothed his supporters with promises of treats. On election day, Dog President is best remembered for winning voters over with big eyes, a wide smile, and a comforting demeanor. He was sworn in on a half-chewed copy of ""Peabody and Sherman.""",0,suicide

My most beloved grandmother passed, and my mother, with no parenting experience took over after quitting her job. From Primary 1-6 (7-12), it wasn't fun. I was beaten and kicked out of the house for even just a small mistake. Back then my studies were fairly decent, averaging As on my tests. Bullying was a major problem, being shoved around, called names, hurt physically and emotionally. Seconday School rolls along. I'm fucked, I can't keep up in school, I'm simply starting to be ostracized. I feel helpless.

I was also able to get on medicaid and see a psychiatrist.  The medications reduced the depression and anxiety greatly.   But, now that I've finished the online program, graduated for once, I'm boxed in by fear.  I'm scared to death of working in a refinery as an operator.  I'm much more comfortable working with my hands, and would have been been way better of going to school to become a rotating equipment mechanic and work on the equipment in the refinery, not operate it.  I'm 33 now, I used up my window of time and funding for retraining, and I'm no further than where I started.  I have medications now, but online school led to a regression.  I've been by myself in front of a screen for almost two years.  If I had gone on campus and done a mechanical program I would have been raring to go.  I don't see a way out of this shit, maybe back to the rigs, but I'm going to run into the same shit.  I can't get rid of my fear.  Might as well call it all off.  ",1,suicide
4679,"Waking Up, Back to Sleep  I've been dealing with integrating a lot of small truths for a while to make sense of all the pain I feel. I built the story of why I want to kill myself for a long long long time because I think I need some very good reason. The truth is I just felt like it, because I do what I want. It's terrifying to realize you made all your mistakes because you wanted to. I needed to end up in this rough a state to get through that. Self-sabotage is a hell of a trip. I think killing myself is selfish because I think living my life is selfish. I've been surveying my own inadequacy this whole time, and finally decided that I deserve to die. It's been a long long trial and I feel very guilty. I have always been the judge. It's okay it's okay it's okay. Everything is okay. Nothing is okay. Nothing I've done has been okay. its chill its chill calm down. What am I saying? Is this a story about myself or a story about how shitty I feel? Do I have enough money yet? Do I have enough freedom yet? Am I the master of my domain? Did I figure it out yet? Sure, why not. Is this a eulogy or a suicide note or self-reflection? Surewhynot. Of course. I know everything so of course I'm worthless and deserve to die. I knew it from the beginning! I'm so fucking smart! I figured it out before anyone else! I tricked everyone into thinking I'm worthwhile!!!!!!!!!!!!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'M A PIECE OF SHIT wait I went there already. Everyone who dies is great. Make America Great Again. Make Death Great Again. Make Life Great Again. IF LIFE ISN'T GREAT WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE OH SHIT IT'S A CONSPIRACY TO MAKE US ALL SAD! GOD DOESN'T WANT ME TO EXIST, OR SOMETHING!

Were both pretty shy so for the first 10 min or so we didn't say much, then I decided to break the silence and ask her how her day was and we went back and forth from there. we started to talk about how are sperate live are going and while she was talking I tried not to look at her chest (she was wearing a somewhat reavling shirt) and over a period of time I started to get off... Then when I started to share, I mentioned how my uncle was arrested for something he didn't do and she tried to put her hand on my thigh as a comforting manner but I ended up turning to my side so I could face her and her hand landed on my crotch area. Immediately it fell silent and both of our faces were flushed red, neither of us moved for what felt like an hr (and yes that includes her hand...)

I've had a lot of suicidal ideation in the past but I never did anything about it apart from self-harm &amp; other reckless behaviour like taking drugs. I've been depressed for about 2 months. I quit smoking weed for my mental health but I think quitting made the depression resurface. But I can't smoke again because I've got schizophrenia and weed makes the symptoms a lot worse. Anyway something has changed. I never drink &amp; now I'm pouring myself a genourous portion of vodka just so I can escape for a while. I've self-harmed again after not doing it since January. I think I'm going to take a seroquel overdose. I've got plenty of them. I'm not going to do it tonight but I have very strong urges to. I've never taken an OD before but that's what my brain is urging me to do. I don't even know if I'm ready to die but I can't go on much longer. My depression is unbearable &amp; my schizophrenia has pretty much destroyed a lot of things for me. Used to have a lot of potential before my first episode of psychosis a few years ago.

Went through the phases where you don't think about it as much but you know it's still there, but now I'm not getting lucky to have another phase start.  Out of the thousands of times I've thought about dying, I couldn't never find a suitable way. I have a deep fear of knives and blood, which is apparently stronger than my desire to die. I live in Canada so I'm gun free, which is I think how I'd like to go. Thought about the ropes and everything but I don't think there's anywhere in my apartment that's high enough. ETC I frequently get upset with myself for not being able to make up my mind and get to it.  In general, from one human to another, I'm scared, I'm anxious, I'm uncomfortable, and I'm tired of feeling the same nothingness day in and day out, every second of everyday, the same bland and miserable feeling. I'm just tired.  Thanks for reading",1,suicide

Everyone has low points but every time something happens, even if it's minor, my first thought is finding a way to off myself without causing anyone in my life too much pain. I spent at least an hour today thinking about it. How it would feel to stop existing, formulating a plan to cause the least amount of collateral damage. I found a belt in my closet and my thoughts immediately turned to how easy it would be to off myself with it tied to my bed post.

It's like I'm not connected to myself any more and I find it very hard to be present. I talk to people and realise it's been months or even a year and to me it's like yesterday, still days are long as hell. I feel mentally behind, like I've turned into one of those that you talk to and everyone is making faces and reacting to their behaviour behind their backs and they have no idea. I can barely remember most of my life.  I don't want anything. Nothing gives me joy or excitement. I've been offered trips abroad, days out, items. I've lost money, chances and things just because of inaction and I don't even give a shit. Not even the thought of a nice bath or nice meal or things usually mentioned by others give me even a spark. I have zero friends since I can't be present and most of the time I can't handle to interact with people any way. Sometimes I wish I had someone to talk to about just random things or play games with but I tend to drop people because I'm an idiot that can't keep up any more.  I don't even know how to describe the feeling of being so *flat* 24/7 365. Often my mood dips and I'm closer to killing myself than I have ever been. It's not even when I'm tired or stressed any more, just randomly at any time. I have a strong need for control when it comes to how and where I die, but recently I've thought of just jumping in front of a truck driving past my house or stabbing myself on a whim. It scares me a bit.  It's like my chest is holding in this insane sadness. The only thing I feel that is not sadness or nothing is a kind of longing for wanting to want something again.

You're expected to keep up with everyone else and make it to the finish line, but every time your feet hit the ground it's excruciating agony. It's the most painful at first. Over time your legs start to heal, but it's very very slow. Nobody else who's running beside you understands your pain - their legs aren't broken. They may talk about being out of breath or wanting some water, but you feel all of those things and the pain of broken legs. You know that you can leave the race and sit down in the grass, and that your pain will disappear. But you also don't know what's ahead of you.  And that's why you have to fight it. Your legs may hurt so, so much. You may never feel like the other runners understand you. But what you don't know is the race is cutting through gorgeous mountains. And a waterfall.

I get to look at other people being happy while I loathe over my meal.  I have no job. I tried getting a summer job to help pay some expenses for school. Mcdonalds didn't want me. Manager promised to call me for an interview. Never did.  Tried another job that had a help wanted sign. I've been in the store 4 times now- they keep telling me to come back cause they never have applications. This has been going on for a month now. They can go fuck off. I only keep going for the off chance I'll get a job for the remaining week before I head off for school. Which won't happen.  My family despises me because I'm not religious. They also think I'm a failure because I do nothing all day but watch anime on my computer and play videogames. I never go outside unless its to inquire about a job. I've gone outside 7 times this summer. I've been off from school since May.  My cat hates me too. She no longer wants to play with me.  My dream job is to work for google but if I can't get a summer job what's to say I'll get a job at a major company. Yeah right.  All I'm doing is gaining and gaining a shitton of debt from the school I go to. I constantly dream of getting in a horrific car crash so that I can be permanently disabled.

Goddamn this post is a fucking mess. Here's hoping the 4th attempt will be the charm. ",1,suicide

4787,"The more you want to kill yourself, the more you feel like there's no other way?It's official...  I've started living just to sleep. I've justified some pretty stupid stuff, like drinking myself broke, abusing the trust of my friends and family, etc, all with the idea that my self-administered death is just on the horizon.  I have not always necessarily felt suicidal, but more and more I feel like it might be what I've chosen, like a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have a deep, deep-seated inferiority complex that makes it difficult-to-impossible to acquiesce to being helped or taught anything, so I have not sought a medical diagnosis or any methods of treatment, nor have I told anyone how I feel about all this.    I drink myself to sleep every night, just because the night-time hours are the hardest and weed doesn't work on its own anymore.  When I don't drink, I want to kill myself. I guess I'm just tired of putting on a brave face.  Good God, I'm so tired.  I can't imagine a future in which I like who I am, or in which I'm capable of expressing myself, and I've tried to believe it exists but right now I really want to just end it.  I don't want to live with all this anger and hate. Like I said, I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas; what would you suggest to someone who hates themself so much they don't want to get better?  Who shirks anything that might be remedial (that isn't booze or weed) and shuns all ideas that come from external sources? When I was in high school, I went to the doctor and told him I had trouble finding reasons to get out of bed in the morning and he told me to do anything, as long as it was something, and that some sort of natural desire to continue living would surely reawaken, or some bullshit like that.  Went to counselling a few years later, and that cunt told me the same thing.  Since then, I've done absolutely nothing.   I'm an absolute bare minimum person in every conceivable way. Anyways, I want to know what you think I should do, as long as it isn't ""anything"".  I live in BC and I'm trans, if that makes things harder/easier.  ",1,suicide

Which leads me to the conclusion that nothing matters and that has been my philosophy ever since I can think. This made me think about death early. To this day I believe that death is pure nothingness, which seems like the ultimate form of existence to me. I want to become part or this nothingness and I do not want anything else this world has to offer, I only live on because I have been raised or rather programmed to care about those closest to me, even though that doesn't make any sense to me if I think about it.

There are other issues going on in my life, which are causing me to feel this way.  I just want to know if this is normal for someone to feel this way?

4835,"Helpful Christmas tips from me to you: 1. Bigger is not always better. Sometimes the best gifts are in the smallest packages, so do not be upset if your gift is not the huge box in the corner addressed to your little brother. 2. A gift that rattles when you shake it is NOT always Lego. Just...don't get to excited. 3. If it is a big box, when you pick it up, tilt it. If the center of mass changes, it's probably a ""Russian nesting doll"" box, and there is a fake weight inside. 4. Check to see if your parents start recording you while you open the gift. If they do, you're about to get something gooood. 5. Stockings are the most underrated part of Christmas morning. I mean, it's all just candy and crap, but it tastes good. The socks that you also get in there will probably come in handy too. 6. Finally, thank the person who got you the gift. Mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, aunt, uncle. Doesn't matter. Give them a big hug and smile. This, in turn, will put you on their favorites list for next year, essentially getting you more gifts. I hope these tips and tricks serve you well, and don't forget- it's all just a corporate scheme for money! Have a Merry Christmas everyone!",0,suicide

4858,"Painless, effective, and dignified suicide is out of my reachI'm at the end of the line. I've attempted suicide numerous times in my teenage years by overdosing on prescription psych meds but I stopped taking them years ago because they did nothing but hurt me more. I still have quite a bit left over (various brands) but after researching online, none of them will kill me in the quantities I have. I would just be left in a coma or have permanent organ damage. I just want to die in peace. One final moment of peace is all I want before I embrace eternity.  So I started thinking about other ways to do it. I don't have firearms, and even if I did, I'd be too scared of flinching or backing out due to the horrible risk of surviving mutilated. I don't know how/where to get fentanyl, but the idea of my mother finding my bloated body, frothing at the mouth, isn't appealing either. I settled on starvation because it's easily accessible plus the thought of food makes me nauseated, and I actually got several days in before learning that it's one of the most painful and least dignified ways out there. I can't do anything right, including suicide. I don't want to be alive anymore because life is just neverending moments of disappointment and pain. I need to die. I told myself I'd wait until my parents died but I just can't. ...being asked to prolong my suffering just for their comfort is too much.

My only conscious thought after 15 minutes was that it'd be a painful death, and so I tried to vomit up as many of the pills as I could. During this my mother discovered what had happened and an ambulance was called. I spent about 24 hours in hospital as they ran tests. I was extremely disoriented the entire time and due to covid I spent all of my time in the hospital alone. I have no access to my family as I had no phone, and so I basically stared at a wall for 17 hours straight. Psychiatrists saw me, as did doctors. They told me I was very lucky to have managed to get the painkillers out of my system. They forwarded letters to my doctor advising her on what had happened, and sent me home after about 24 hours of monitoring and tests. My family have rallied around me, which is nice. My boyfriend is hurting and in shock but he's been there for me. I hurt him a lot because I didn't say goodbye, and I feel terrible for that. None of my friends know.

Like this, with tons of anxiety and guilt, like a hopeless mess stuck in a pattern of bad behaviour.  I feel suicidal, and no, I don't seem validation from you all, but I am really tired. If anyone's been through a shitstorm like this, please opine, because I am done trying and losing my mind.",1,suicide

Everytime I have moved to a new place I have ofcourse started in new schools and got to meet new people and made good friends with some of them.  These friends of mine are long gone because of me moving to different places over and over again. This was between me being 6 years old to 16 years old. I have during these past 2 years been in my single room apartment alone. I have been severly depressed for 6 years because of my thoughts. I have had to start over again and again with new friends, new schools and new things. I have lost motivation to go out and meet new people. I have lost the ability to be happy over several things that once made me who I am. I have isolated myself from the world for a very long time and have had issues with my suicide thoughts.

4916,"Ruined my life but there's one thing keeping me aliveHello. I don't want to make it a wall of text so I'll make it as short as possible. From as a long as I can remember I always excelled at school etc. I've got a very good memory and always had perfect grades with no much effort. Now I am a 19yo, second year med student having summer break. But that's the only thing I am good at. Because I had too much time for myself I wasted last 10 years of my life on games and computer. Parents would let me do that because education is the only thing that mattered to them. That time kinda ruined my apperance. Of course, genetic factors most certainly affected that. I would be probably taller if I slept more. My teeth wouldn't would be so (asymmetrically)  crooked had I kept proper posture. And acne wouldn't be that troublesome if I cared about my skin. It's not even that bad in any of these case. But there are people being depressed about one of these things. I have all of these flaws, and combined they overweigh the good things in my life. I wouldn't care about that so much but I am gay, and LGBT community taught me that only looks matters. Even worse, I am only into models so it's damn hard for me to be sexually satisfied.  And my family despite being quite wealthy, won't give me money to fix these things because they it's just vanity for them. While gays of my age party, get drunk and sleep with different people every night I have to collect money for necessary procedures (I don't want to wear standard metal braces, I'd rather collect that 3-4k euro for invisalign braces/lingual braces than show myself with those ugly metal things in my mouth) and cry about what I could be if I made different decisions in life. It doesn't seem that I am suicidal right now but I change mood very quickly. When I see perfect boys at my age I immediately start hating myself to the point of autoagression and lose hope that I could ever be as attractive as them, despite my future possibilites as a doctor to improve my looks even further (access to aesthetic procedures and plastic surgeons). Sorry for my English and the chaos in my post. ",1,suicide

My parents had sent me to schools which said they would look after me but they never did, the schools and my parents ignored my cries for help (until I was 14) because I was young or something along the lines like that. People bullied me, teachers didn't help, and other emotional trauma that I had encountered. My high school deemed me as a child who wouldn't understand or obey rules even though I tried my best; they literally gave me detention for doing nothing and they would move my seat in classes often for no reason. My parents took me out of school after I started to show anxiety and tears to them, I developed a twitch, a stale personality and memories that will never leave me. I wouldn't mind telling them but I'm not sure how to fit them in here. I know if I die, people will miss me. My parents love me, my (four) friends will miss me and so will my pets. But all of this trauma that I cry every day about won't go away, it made my social life become non-existent, no teacher would help me so my grades fell drastically. Currently I am at this special school for autistic kids but I still feel the same (even though they are a nicer school that supports me). But besides this, I realised that there is no point for me in life, in the end the world and the universe itself will be destroyed meaning my presence isn't valuable. I told my parents this and they are also worried, but I just can't handle all of this because of how the schools treated me and harmed me. The therapists I go to try to help but I know that they wont, they will just end up giving me medication that will dull my mind, I won't be my self. Even one of my therapists said that it was all my fault, saying that I did all of this and everything else was in my head.

5034,"Life just fucked me. prison of death?Recently my life have been turned upside down, fucked sideways and then ran over by a train. I have been charged with conspiracy to armed robbery as well as weed charges. I am very young and was in college until recent events. I'm your typical college student just studying and trying to chill and graduate. Because of legal issues i am not going to include specific details that might harm me in my case in this post. So a few month ago i was charged with conspiracy to armed robbery because i was stupid, young, and friends with the wrong people. I DID NOT help commit any robbery or help plan them but some evidence makes it look as i might of? My lawyer is telling me that their is not much evidence against me but i'm still looking at jail time. He previously said 10-15 years MAX but now i'm probably looking at 3-5 years MAX and MAYBE probation. Recently the thought of going to prison keeps hovering above my head like a cloud and is making me want to not live anymore. I just feel like i have disappointed everyone in my life. I have made many of my friends who were living with me suffer as they were arrested with me(drugs). Especially my parents who have put in so much effort in raising me and making sure i can lead a good life. I feel like i have ruined my whole life and have no future. How can i spend YEARS in prison doing nothing... i be better of dead. There is nothing more horrible then spending my days doing nothing but looking at a cell wall while knowing everyone my friends and family are all going on with their lives. These days i can't concentrate on anything and waves of depression just hits me randomly. As my court date gets closer and closer all i can think about is everything that i am leaving behind because of my stupidity. I don't really want to live knowing my life is ruined. I don't want to spend any time in jail.  So if anyone have been in my position or has some advice please do not hesitate to comment -Lost Soul",1,suicide

5042,"(low priority) i finally started thinking about itI'm in no immediate danger. I'm not even sure this is the right subreddit for it.   It's just... I've been doing great. I've been working on my career so it'd look great in my CV, my body is sore of the immense workouts, I'm studying a lot of things, I even managed myself brushing teeth twice a day instead of once (or none at all). I have even read a fiction book, for the first time in, like, 5 years. I have no idea what caused this. It was 5:00 AM, I jumped into the car, feeling really sad and alone and hoping that it'd cheer me up, drove right to the nearest McDonalds' drive-thru. I was crying, like, for 20 minutes. Then, out of nowhere, I had a thought that it'd be a great time to kill myself.   Perhaps, a McMuffin saved my life - that shit is awesome.   I hesitate telling anyone close to me about that. I think I'm overreacting. I _am_ overreacting. It's really irrational and stupid, and I haven't even ran of the possible options to climb out of it - like, saving some money to finally get a therapist instead of wasting it on gas and junk food. It's just a nice thought to have. I don't really contribute anything crucial to the community. I do my best to support my friends and my girlfriend in their tough times. I like to think that I'm not that bad at it. And now, when I feel I need someone of them to talk to, I just think ""nah, they won't help me anyway. What do they know about that feeling. It'd just make things worse. They could even gossip about me. They'll just dismiss it."" It takes a lot of preparing - if I were serious to kill myself, I'd make damn sure it would be lethal. I'm too lazy to prepare.  But the McMuffins solution™ won't last long. And, being depressive (but not suicidal) for a long time makes me think that I'm becoming suicidal. I'm just curious how much time I've got left till I choose to do it. How the hell do I say the truth to them that I'm not OK without them feeling shitty or sorry for me. ",1,suicide

And most my classes were really late cause I live in a different time zone and there's an 8 hour time difference so I never really got any sleep cause I finish classes at around 1-2 am and I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning for work and for the college here in my home country. I've been struggling with my mental health throughout the entire semester and it really effected how productive I was and I knew I wasn't gonna do well but I thought I'd at least pass. I somehow managed to fail 4/5 subjects I was taking in the university and one of the two subjects I was taking in my college. And I'm in a situation where I might get expelled from the university and I'll have to stay here in a homophobic country (I'm gay and if anyone here found out I'll get the death sentence immediately because they don't mess around when it comes to these things) and that university was my only escape from here.  I guess I'm just at the point where not only do I not have any reasons to live but I also have a lot of reasons why not to live and the idea of finally doing it seems like the only solution now and is probably the only way out of this mess I put myself in.  There's no one to blame here but me because I obviously bit off way more than I can chew and it's probably the main reason I'm here right now.

I don't want to go into much detail here but I'll make short summary - I've been fighting with depression for past 6/5 years or so. I stared to have suicidal thoughts 3 years ago. At the beginning I didn't want to talk about it with my parents. I have a support in my teachers and friends. But, you know, they can't go with me to the doctor. So I tried to speak with my parents. It took me 3 tries to eventually give up. All of those conversation ended with my mother saying things like ""You'll get us in trouble"" or other nasty things I can't really recall right now.  I feel like my life stared to slip out of my hands again. My grades lowered, I fell isolated, I feel that I'm a burden to every single person that I've met. What shouls I do?

5106,"I Feel Like God Is Telling Me To Kill MyselfA couple of months ago I started contemplating suicide because of a certain issue. During that time, certain things happened and it almost feels as if God is trying to tell me to kill myself. I was once on the Youtube homepage, and I clicked on a song suggestion. The song was ' West End Girls ' by the Pet Shop Boys. The first line of that song is '' Sometimes you're better off dead, if there's a gun in your house aim it at your head ''. I immediately closed the song. I'm not sure if this happened on the same day, but it happened close to that time. I was again on Youtube, and I saw a thumbnail for a song suggestion. "" God was never on your side '' by Motorhead. Despite being a Motorhead fan, I had never heard that song before. The reason why this title struck me so hard was because earlier this year, something happened which caused me to believe that the exact opposite was in place. That God was on my side because something positive had happened and I was feeling very thankful. But that positive thing turned negative a few months ago, which is what caused me to become suicidal. And I feel like this song suggestion was like a '' Haha gotcha loser '' message from God.  I have gotten a few other moments like that. Where I've seen things which eerily remind me of my situation. And what I've seen has always involved the element of death. I feel like God is laughing at me up there and is turning my life into a joke.  I'm not even that religious. I'm agnostic but I've always leaned towards the idea that there might be some universal power out there.  But what I'm experiencing right now has got me convinced.",1,suicide

I dont even know if my company can come  back strong after this so I just might leave. I'm just going to get a normal factory job. I used to draw and now I just cant. No motivation.

I was afraid I'd pass out, so I removed the belt and felt a slight rush for a few minutes afterwards... I really want to do it again, but I don't fully understand why. Strangely, I also feel very little towards this particular incident. But most of the time I feel empty anyways, so this may be extension of that. I also kind of want to tell my dad about it because we are somewhat close and he knows about my depression. I know it's bad but I don't particularly care if he gets upset about it. Can I please talk to someone (over PM) about what just happened?",1,suicide

My grandparents and some friends are gone because of this. I'm too much of a coward to actually kill myself I'm too weak and fragile minded. If only I could act on my instincts. I can't do this anymore. Everything is awful. I just wanna feel the nothingness of death. It sounds so peaceful just being nothing. Nothing to be sad about. No way to pity myself. No way to feel anything. Not even existing. If there is a god I wonder if they'd let me not live eternally. This is it. I need to find a method to kill myself. Maybe dehydration. Maybe I can OD.

I don't feel depressed, I just don't want to live, have a job I don't like and work for the rest of my live, until I'm too old to do anything.

But now that I know I will kill myself before I get a job, school just seems more useless than before.  The only thing that would be holding me back in a few years would be my family, but when I'm dead I wouldn't care anyway.  Thinking about finding a job one day, just make me want to cry. My parents always tell my little sister that I will be the one with good grades and a good job, but all the ""good jobs"" are already off my ""possible job"" list.

Beyond the general 'don't ever suicide', I get the impression that if they had to choose then most would recommend (b). Am I right about this? Do you all really think it is preferable to keep people who are nothing but a drag on everything around? Are you really happy that they don't kill themselves, enough to be okay with the likelihood that all their lives are nothing more than an attempt to cope and not actually any other kind of benefit to anyone?

I believe I'm only truly happy when I've got something to look forward too. That thing was university. This has suddenly been snatched from me as I was not invited to join back the second year of my college course. Reasoning behind this is because I work 50 odd miles away from the college and unlike students there I'm older ( 21 ) so have responsibilities and such. Luckily I've been offered a position at another college to do their send year. This means though my job I currently have wouldn't be possible to do anymore as its too much of a journey.  So that part is really getting me down and also I've had a really rough time whilst being at my parents house. My mother despises me and my farther left before I was born and refuses to acknowledge my existence. Meaning the 2 people who are meant to be there for me don't give a shit. It sucks because me and my mum used to be inseparable and she was like my best friend. Now she won't even answer me when I talk to her just ignores me. So leaves me feeling alone. I also have a girl I've been seeing but because of my bipolar it makes not so hard to even show emotion towards her. I don't miss her. And that worries me but I just don't feel it. I wouldn't be upset if she left me but I don't want her too. I just want to feel normal and not  A emotionless twat. Feel like there's nothing left. We live. We die.

They never supported me, and the friends I ended up with were always just as cynical and unsupportive. Growing up the way I did, I felt trapped, insecure, and full of anxiety all the time. Like everyone was watching me fuck up everything. I couldn't ever hold a job for more than a couple of weeks because I'd get extreme anxiety and start having panic attacks and crying before my shifts. I went to a lot of different therapists, and the last one even told me there wasn't any hope for me. So I gave up on trying to find a real job I guess. However I've always been very artistic, and I've been involved with music for all my life. It was the one thing that gave me peace and freedom. I've been in many bands that didn't really go anywhere. These past 6 years, I've been dating this one girl who I fell in love with, but over time, we started to gain a bit of tension because she didn't know how to help me or deal with me at all. While we were together, I moved across a few states to live with her. While I was there, I got with a band that actually held together. We all worked so well together and had a great professional mindset. I felt like I finally found my place. I was under the misunderstanding that my rich/successful accountant girlfriend was okay with me taking care of the house while she brought home the bacon, and we would hope I could make a good enough living on my band someday. Just as we played our biggest headlining show with amazingly huge bands, and got in with one of the biggest booking agencies in NY, she comes in my room and breaks up with me. Nothing I could say would make her want to stay. I built my life around her supporting me, and now I have nowhere to go, and I have to leave my band.

Feels like a myth.) anyways, I forgot to take my meds this morning so now I'm numb, uninterested in everything, and emotionally void. Such fun! Anyways, I just wanted to share this to show some of the lesser seen side of mental health issues. Sometimes depression doesn't look like sxicide attempts and self hxrm and crying and fighting with your family. Sometimes it looks like forgetting to eat food and then not feeling particularly interested in eating any. Sometimes it looks like flipping aimlessly through tv shows because nothing is interesting right now. Sometimes it looks like calling your friends in the hopes of feeling something, and then making an excuse about having to leave after only fifteen minutes of talking. It's not all existential crises and tears and drama and everything tv makes it out to be. Sometimes it's shitty memes and self deprecating jokes and feeling nothing at all. I often look fine when I'm having an episode because I'm just numb, and I'm masking it. It's a lot harder to mask emotional pain than it is to mask feeling nothing at all. And I can't even reach out for help because nothing feels *wrong*. It's just nothing feels *right* either. Anyways, that's my rant.",0,suicide

I've got all I need, I'm not super poor, it's not like there's any major hardships going on. Ya know sure, maybe my mom has some money issue's my little brother is throwing a fit over things and then calling it ""depression and suicide"" just because he's 14 and can't see his girlfriend. Basically saying ""I want it now or I'll kill myself."" Then my fiance just thinks my mom is raising him wrong. We live in the house and he's making it hard for everyone. My fiance thinks that we can just move out and not be our problem. But think of how DISAPPOINTED my mother will be. How much that will hurt me when I'm already hurting. I don't want to talk about it, I just want to stop shaking and feeling like I'm empty. Nothing's wrong, so why the hell do I feel like I need to just.... stop breathing. Not like I can get help, my fiance thinks psychology and psychiatrists are a bunch of bullshit. Words are cheap, I guess. I hate this country, I hate this world. I wish I lived in Canada. If I can just hold out until I get a job maybe, but I'm not sure about my fiance..... I just want to stop breathing permanently. But I can't.",1,suicide

5291,"How to bypass Parental Controls and get to Reddit and Youtube So here are a few things you can do to get to Reddit and Youtube if your parents don't let you have safari or reddit or youtube because of Parental Controls. The first one is probably the broadest one: use settings (on an iphone). Open up settings and click ""Passwords and Accounts"". Press ""Add Account"" and click Aol. Make an account, and when you are done with that, follow all the steps and then you should get back to the place where you clicked Aol. Click Aol one more time and then log in with the account you just created. After putting in your password, you should see something like ""by agreeing, you will allow ios to..."" and then four boxes. Scroll to the bottom and then, above the agree button, there is a link that says "" I agree to the AOL OpenID and OAuth terms"" click that and you should be brought to the Verizon mobile website. press the stacked pancakes in the corner and click privacy center, and then Third Parties. Scroll down until you see a black link that says "".google analytics"". click that and click the google logo above it. Congratulations! you are in google. you can look things up, but the top part of Reddit and Youtube is unaccessible, but that is worth it, because who would block Settings overnight. My second exploit is News, and it is the one I am using right now. If your parents allow the News app, put this link into Notes. https://apple.news/AeeNh6cCEQs6rWyMuLoKsmQ Scroll down until you see a link saying about Bangor News. click that, wait for it to load, then scroll down a little bit and click the Reddit icon. it will have you log in, then it will want you to post a link, but you can just get out of it.

5295,"I'm a burden to everyoneI don't think I deserve to be alive but I don't have the willpower to kill myself. All I ever do is push away the people who care about me so that eventually I'll have nobody left to be hurt when I finally do it.  I can't go a week without forgetting to pay a bill or missing an appointment or forgetting to finish something I was supposed to, and the people who care about me suffer because of it. They tell me I'm not a burden, but that's just objectively not true. My presence in people's lives leaves them worse off than better. That's not to say I don't create anything positive, only that I create more negative. That makes it harder to deal with, because I give people just enough reason to think I'm redeemable and not a terrible person before I pull out the rug and fuck them over again. My parents have supported me for so long, and all I've got to show for it is almost failing out of an amazing university. They're paying rent on an apartment at school, even though I probably won't be able to go back, and now they want to pay for a place for me to live here. WHY? Why on earth do they keep making these sacrifices? I'm not worth that. Eventually I'm just gonna fuck that up as well. I have an interview Friday that I'm totally unprepared for, and never will be. Just another in a long series of disappointments.  There's no good way for me to solve my life.  If I kill myself, I'll hurt the people that care about me, so I can't, at least, not yet. All that's left for me to do is keep failing and burning the relationships I have left, until they all do what they should and give up on me. Then nobody will be left to feel hurt by my death.

They know I had to go to the doctors to get hormones checked for the hair (which didn't help with anything), but they don't know how bad it is. They don't know that it's worse than every guy I've ever met, they don't know that I'm developing chest hair and stomach hair. I hide everything. I only wear hoodies and jeans. I never wear anything I like because of the hair. If they ever find out about how hairy I am, they wouldn't want to be friends with me anymore.

5350,"I feel like the good part of me already diedHey, guys.  I'm so scared of myself lately. To make a long story short, I was recently in a relationship. My first serious one, actually. It ended when my ex got blackout drunk and beat me. I was left with a concussion, black eye, bite marks, bruises on my sides and arms, and a split lip. I was also choked. There had never been any physical abuse prior and nothing (that I can pinpoint) set it off. He had been under a lot of stress at work, but that's it. It was St. Patrick's Day and he got really, really drunk (not unusual) and when we got back and were going to bed, it happened.  I have only told one family member since. I haven't felt the same since the day it happened. I don't know if I will ever trust anybody again. I've never been physically hurt so badly in my life. I keep wishing he had actually just killed me. I can't be happy anymore, I cant do anything. Somehow I managed to finish out the semester and now I've graduated undergrad, but I wasn't even happy about that. I want to be excited to look for a job and get my life started but I want to die so, so badly.  The past 2 months have been so hard. Every time I get in the car I want to just floor it into a tree. My family would be devastated but I'm not the same anymore anyway, and they've noticed. My mother in particular, who just thinks I'm a frigid bitch now because I don't talk, I don't smile, nothing. The best parts of me are gone and I don't even recognize myself anymore. I feel like I died the night he attacked me, the good parts of me, anyway. What's left is so empty. Every day I promise myself I'll do it, and I'm so afraid I'm actually going to. I have notes written explaining what happened and why for my family when I do.

The reason I can't do it is because I feel like deep down I just want people to notice me by being dead and I feel like that's just wanting attention.

Anyway after 3 months I finally got an appointment from my psychiatrist who didn't even check her notes to see that I did in fact try to kill myself. After the appointment she had put me on new medication; diazapam and lithium for bipolar and anxiety but the transition to these drugs from my last which I am still on has potential lead to more aggressive suicidal thoughts that I might actually act on rather than my usual suicidal thinking where I don't think I will commit because I have no idea why we are here so I  might as well carry on and see what happens, but I've spent almost all my time in the past 2 years In my room doing nothing due to extreme axiety. Atm I feel ok but over the past week if anything slightly negative happens to me my first thought is self harm or suicide. I have thought about going to hospital but atm I seem to be alright but if I do see myself getting worse I will go to hospital for my own safety. I am 19 almost 20 m from the UK. Hopefully once this medication settles down I will be much more stable but atm I really don't see myself living very ling because generally I want to die. In my life I've done nothing and don't see myself doing anything and I will most definitely struggle to part take in this society we live In as it seems fundamentally flawed and I don't seem to see a way to take part or fit in. I'm not gonna kill myself today  but see it as a probably in the future which is unfortunate as there is most likely a great life out there for me to live but if it were to happen it seems so distant and not worth the wait In which I will be suffering immensely.

I work in a warehouse as a supervisor. My job is essential so I have to work during this pandemic. Ever since I got promoted to a supervisor I feel like I'm getting worse and worse. I hate the job now and decided I needed to look elsewhere for a different job however this pandemic has stalled out everything so it's hard to move to something else.

On top of all that this pandemic has made the job a nightmare. It's getting to the point where I can't physically or mentally handle it anymore. I've started to take more Tylenol than usual in hopes that I get sick enough to where I don't have to go in. Sometimes add alcohol to the mix if I'm feeling really shitty. I think it's slowly working because I'm frequently fatigued, having on and off abdominal pain, and frequent headaches I know it's stupid and I know I'm putting myself at serious risk but I feel trapped and there has to be a way out. I can't keep doing this job for much longer. I know deep down I should be thankful that I can still make good money during this time, but I just need a God damn break and there seems to be no end in sight. Granted I have been passively suicidal for awhile now and not just because of my job, but it's getting to the point where I can't handle the stress anymore. I don't want to leave, but I gotta do something before inevitably kill myself. What can I do? TL;DR: My job is getting out of hand and the stress is making me more and more suicidal.

This is what I've taken: wellbutrin, abilify, celexa, remeron, effexor, cymbalta, paxil, adderall, vyvanse, and probably some others that I can't remember.  The only ones that really ever worked were the Effexor and Remeron and they only worked for about 2 months.   During my recent hospitalizations I have gotten ECT (electroshock) five times, and that's a normal course.  It didn't help.  I'd feel good for about 2 days and then sink back into crazy shit.  I really don't know what to do.  I'm a scientist myself and I know when psychiatrists don't know what to do.  I've spent years trying to figure out my issues but of course I am ignored as a crazy person.  I don't like things.  I feel like I either don't produce enough dopamine or I absorb it too quickly.  I've told this to so many psychiatrists and they just prescribe me a new SSRI.  I don't think it's serotonin that's the problem but who listens to a crazy person that can't finish school?  Anyway, I don't know what to do at this point.  Every time I've been in the hospital it's been because I've tried to kill myself.  The more they try to help, and end up failing, the more I justify my actions.  I'm totally open to help.  I've had huge amounts of CBT and other forms of therapy and it has really helped me in certain respects but not the ones that stick... not the ones that make me happy to be alive.   **TL:DR**  What do you do when all of the options have been exhausted?

The only reason to why he's still with me is that I might kill myself if he leaves. I don't mean it as a threat, but I honestly don't know what I'll do if even the most kind and patient person I know gives up on me. I've always said I'll change but I'm just always the same. I've started therapy but there's so much crap behind my bad habits and all. He says I don't care about him and I never listen. But in my head and heart I always have. I can't tell how I feel anymore. If I really do care about him why am I still like this? If I really love him enough surely I'll be better already. The conclusion is that even if I'm not aware of it, I'm selfish and don't care about anyone else, my feelings matter more than theirs. I don't even realise what I'm doing, how am I going to fix it?

But the big think is that the world is getting more fascist, we're killing more people, poverty is increasing, and people think the solution is either a white ethnostate or using different words and being more liberal.  The world is not getting better, the worse is getting easier and easier to find, and I haven't even held someone else's hand since my divorce 10 years ago.

5462,"I have a pain disorderI suffer from something called trigeminal neuralgia. It's extremely rare in people my age (24), and in particular how advanced mine is. It sends random unpredictable electric shocks from my ear to my mouth and jaw. The pain is absolutely unbearable, even with medicine and surgery. Nothing helps it. The worst part though is that it's random. I'm living every second anticipating that shock of pain, never knowing when it will happen.  My only other option is to go on heavy, opioid painkillers but I think is rather just die. My dad had a pain disorder too and was addicted to pain meds (not because he wanted to get high, his pain was so bad he became dependent on them.) A tiny part of me says to try the painkillers and if it doesn't work, then do it. But the majority of me says go ahead and just end it.  I don't know what to do anymore. ",1,suicide

Things got better, I have never experienced such happiness as watching a movie with her as she rests her head on my chest. But now I don't know.  She noticed something was wrong with me, and I went ahead and told her about my depression and how much I hated myself. She seemed surprised. From then on, she started answering my texts slowly, or not at all. We used to talk for hours, and now she barely acknowledges me. Last night i had an episode, one that nearly pushed me over the edge, so I messaged her, out of desperation, hoping for just a little bit of happiness to come from our conversation.  But nothing came. She was snide and sarcastic, completely different from usual. I was devastated. I thought about taking that Beretta out from under my bed and putting it in my mouth then and there. The only thing that stopped me was the thought of how sad that would make her.  But now I don't know. I really care for her, and I want the relationship to continue, but not if she's unhappy. But at the same time, im completely devoid of anything attractive or beautiful, she doesn't deserve to have to deal with me. I want her to happy. I have a list, titled Ways to Die.

Above me, attached to a chinup bar, dangled a belt \- primed with a loop. This wasn't the first time, but it was the closest and calmest. It's not that I have nothing to live for.  I am conscious, just like you, with everything to experience, but it's just not enough to keep me interested.  I need something more. 9 years ago, at age 29, I developed psychosis, schizophrenia and lost my white collar, 6 figure job.  I've been unable to work since. I saw behind the veil that is the reality we see as the norm.  I was time and space, the yin and yang.  I was the alpha and the omega.  It was fantastic and magical being connected to everything in existence.  Also, I was very lonely knowing this. I was alienated from my circles of friends, and became a hermit, however I'm sane now and have been for years. Around 2012, I started to feel myself regular old self again, but I've seen behind the curtain that makes up existence.  The best analogy I can give, is that of finding out Santa Claus isn't real, and then spending the rest of your life trying to re\-believe in him.  It won't happen.  For me, that Santa Claus is reality.  I've tried writing music, software, exercise, diet, psych meds and friends.  There is some short term benefit, but it's not enough.  Life is too fucking long. By my count, I've made around 7 attempts on my life since 2009.  Tourniquet, rope, oxycodone, pocket knife, alcohol.  Some more than once.  They all hurt, or hurt afterwards \(like waking up in vomit with a hangover from too much oxy\).  Pain and discomfort are the last things you want to experience for your exit. If there was a button in front of me to make this stop, I'd press it in an instant.  I really don't want help.  I want a solution.

She had let me borrow it before and thought it might be in my room. I told her I thought I had given it back, but I would like anyways. She got all pissed and started going on about how she has no idea why I was ever born, that all I do is fuck up her life, i've never done anything good for her.

I checked if my computer still worked and it did. Good job. My computer is fine. Well this morning, I scoot my computer back so it's at a better place so I can work more comfortable. Well there was a shit ton of water under my computer all night. I thought it was all okay still since this exact situation had happened before and my computer was still working after. I cleaned up the water and was about to get to work and my computer didn't turn on. Worse yet, I am failing a lot of classes because I got overwhelmed by my teachers assigning to much. To add some irony! My nephews had spilled my water AFTER I got my door fixed to close properly. Which means in the literally two minutes between me leaving my door open while going to the bathroom and me getting back my nephew had spilled my water. I should have just closed my door. That's the computer I do most of my schoolwork on, rather than my actual school computer because my personal just works better. My school laptop is just shit, and mine seems to have more problems than everyone else's for whatever reason. I use that computer for Twitch, which I'm grounded right now and I don't really stream so that's not a problem, and I use it for gaming. Now that's still not a problem. But do you know what is? The fact that my personal computer is how I practice music because the speakers are a million times better than my school computer's. My dad said that best case my computer just needs to dry and it will be fine and worst case scenario he can just take the hard drive out and put it in a new body.

I highly recommend a hot pepper plant it takes a lot of care but it can be worth it and it can add some spice into your cooking if your into that 3. Coloring, painting, drawing.

Taking care of something else can help you take your mind off of things for a bit 5. Talk to someone.

I am currently failing every subject at school and I don't complete my work anymore. Feel free to call me lazy, I'm used to being criticized all the time.  The truth is, I am too depressed to even try anymore. I've given up on everything because I know I am going to pass away very soon. Part of me is scared to go through with it, but the other part of me is screaming that I need to end my life.  I used to be afraid of death, but I'm not anymore. I like the thought of eternal sleep. I'm looking forward to it. No thoughts, no pain, nothing. Just pure darkness.  The thing I am least looking forward to is the passing away progress. Will I feel pain? What will be my last thought?  I've considered reaching out for help, but I am scared of what people might think. How will my parents react? What will they do?  My 16th birthday is later this month. I should be getting my license and spending time with my family, but instead I'll be laying in a coffin.  I know I am going to miss out on a lot, like potentially having my own family one day, or feeling better later. I can't wait that long. The pain is unbearable. I just want it to stop.

I'd hide my breakdowns and panic attacks in the toilet so no one's really caught on. Today I've seen my friend get driven to the edge cuz of a small misunderstanding in an exam and I was scared he'd cut himself and I couldn't help him, all I could say was to let me know how I could help. Something's snapped and now I'm laying in bed crying and wishing I don't wake up tomorrow, I tried to picture myself dying but honestly it still scares me, but I'm not sure how long more that's gonna deter me.

5584,"I'm just really fatigued and want/need some way to move onI feel like my whole life I've been unhappy with who I am and what I can do. Of all the things I know I can do, I know I can write music, but I just don't show it off, and I don't feel proud of what I'm able to write/create. I want to create something meaningful but its just so nasty. I'm close to graduating with a bachelors in philosophy, and it's useless in a practical sense. A lot of the time I consider buying a gun and blowing my brains out, but I just wish I wasn't such a coward. I want to play my music. It's really pathetic to complain about this shit on the internet, none of my heroes would do this. I would never kill myself as far as I know, but then again, I really don't love or respect myself. I think the real reason I express my fear and discontent is because I don't think I'll really be happy unless I'm successful musically, which is statistically ridiculous. EDIT: Just realized this post may not be suited to this subreddit in particular, but in my drunkenness, I really don't know any other subreddits to post to, so forgive me and point me in the right direction. Again, I apologize and my position towards suicide is much more complicated than ""I am or I'm not.""

5587,"Tip that helps me... maybe it can help you?So I struggle with thoughts of suicide often and have made plans to carry this out on many occasions. I struggle with bipolar type 2 (the depressive type) One thing that helps me almost each time is to make small goals. I will tell myself things like: I have to write letters to every person I care about and then can do it tomorrow,  I can't kill myself until I reach a small milestone with weight loss (or anything you've pursued or wanted to change in the past), that I can't kill myself until I've cleared out my closet for charity, or found someone who will take care of my dogs.  Basically these small goals give me a momentary reason to wait even if it's just until the next day. I know suicidal thoughts can linger for more than just a day (so in those times I set a goal that might take a week to complete) but I do find this to help. Sometimes i just need enough of a goal to make it through an hour, a day, a week because sometimes this can Help postpone it until the feeling may have a chance to pass even when I think at the time there is no possible way for it to pass.  This may or may not help some of you. But it helps me and I thought I'd share. ",1,suicide

I have thought of killing myself, but the methods seem so off-putting -- wouldn't want someone to find my dead body and get mentally scarred by whatever blood-stained expression I have. A random bloody human carcass is the least thing on an average citizen's mind. So far, the only methods I've brainstormed are jumping, cutting, and the usual warm bathtub technique, all of which only leave a sad pile of human cake. Right now, I'm just living like the walking dead. Though I do have some moments of happiness whenever someone cracks a good joke. I just wish I could grab onto some of that energy most people have in order to carry on with their day. Or some sort of positive attitude towards life.

5604,"HeartBreak Lover (41) Heartbreak. Realignment. Feeling all the feels. Numbing. Subconscious. Focused Passion.    In the past year and a half my life has been the most unexpected events possible &amp; I am grateful for it all.       It started 2 springs ago where I met someone through social media that made me stop and think like, wait........who are you? Where did you come from? Your energy is so pure. Friendship and helping each other out with our passion projects which lead to organic feelings. When together, the feelings of being on another planet together and when apart, returning to Earth. These feelings from start to finish were quick lived and by the middle of the summer it was all over. Unexpected. For the first time in more than 5 years I had felt feelings for someone so strong that there were no other thought in mind &amp; then, nothing. All of a sudden.    I was shattered, broken, lost. How did I go from focusing on my passions everyday to then still focusing on my passions but being broken. From that time until 6 months ago, I was numb. I self induced myself with Alcohol Daily. Marijuana Daily, with both becoming a necessity. Still, I was focused. Focused on my passions and what fuelled me from day to day. Heartbreak, let me tell you wasn't expected. It was something that came out of left field but was meant for my process and journey. It allowed me to go through all of the feelings, as well as none at all in the same moment, due to my numbing, to now being healed with those feelings and being one with myself.     Putting love into myself everyday, spending time with myself and releasing the need to be around people all the time. As well as needing the fulfillment from others, I am healing. Its a practice day to day that I am still learning on how to be more present with myself and for the special ones around me.     Going through heartbreak has no ""right"" way to heal from. It was doing what was best for me, which will be different from yours. I am here for you. I am here to listen.     I love you.    Drey &lt;3",0,suicide
