My eyes feel strained and tired. I also have brain fog and feel lightheaded at times. These symptoms have been present for over 3 months straight. Anyone else found this to be a result of heavy stress and anxiety and would medication help ease my symptoms?",1,well_being_reddit_body

2,"Hi everyone, I'm a 19year old male just finished highschool. I will get straight to the point College is too expensive. parents can't afford it, even if they can I wouldn't want to burden them. I will want to pay for my own college. But the problem right now is that my parents are retired. I'm really worried that my parents won't have enough money to pay rent. I can't help them because my parents don't allow me to get a job because of the covid. I know I'm an adult but I don't have a driving license or a car yet. So instead I'm just learning to code day till night every single day. I need at least 6month to be job ready. I hope that I can get a front end job by then. I have many things to learn ( web design, color theory, SEO, coding etc). I have only just started learning to code 1month ago. I feel so stupid and idiotic for not starting it earlier. Negative thoughts have been haunting me recently, Is like I develop another personality. This personality only thinks of the bad thing for example like wanting to stab someone / myself, thinking of parents passing away etc. This kind of thoughts is appearing more often with each day passing. Also there is a side of me that feel like I'm missing out because all of my friends and classmate are all in college. This kind of negative thinking didn't appear at all when I was in school but because I heard from parents that they don't have enough money. Is been bothering me ever since I won't blame my parent and I know where I am now, I will work my way to get it but my headache and stress is getting worse every passing day, Im not taking any day off. Im very worried that my parents won't have enough money to pay rent. I'm worried that I won't have enough time to learn the things needed. I'm really scared that my parent 60+yo will passed away early. All of this is stressing me out really badly I want to help them but I don't know how I can help. I don't have allowance. Worse is that I don't have any skill or talent. I feel like I don't have enough time to learn the things I need to learn because there so many. Sometimes it doesn't even get absorbs by my head because I'm rushing it. Also recently I've been biting my nail and scratching my head till bleeding. I never had this habit before.",1,well_being_reddit_body

I notice myself making poor decisions due to lack of caring and foresight (even though i know what the outcome will be) Sometimes even as far as not being able to think, as if my brain is just a static tv.

16,"I finally managed to persevere and spend this year improving my body and mind. And I am so proud of myself for it. I was skinny-fat my whole life, and was extremely ashamed of my body, to the point where although I lived right next to the sea, I would refrain from going since I had to show my skin. I have tried exercising my whole life, but never stuck to a routine and always ended up quitting after a few weeks as soon as my motivation dwindled. I subconsciously always felt embarrassed about not even being able to do a single proper push-up, and I knew I was disappointing my dad who was a man who grew up in the USSR where being able to do muscle ups at 15 years old was the norm. I had very low self esteem However, I am happy to say that I finally managed to persevere and stuck to a routine for the last 6 months, even keeping a clean diet during the process. What was different this time it’s that I finally had access to a gym, where I could surround myself with like-minded people having the same goals as me. Weight training has made me stronger to the point where I could do dozens of push-ups as well as multiple pull-ups, which I was never able to do before. Even for months after starting to exercise regularly, I still was too embarrassed to show my body, and often times didn’t go to party’s with friends if they involved a pool. However, today was the first day where I looked myself in the mirror and saw real progress, and smiled at myself proudly. I felt a lot of energy and motivation , seeing how far I’ve come.

I'm sure that if I keep going forward, I may reach something that may make me happy eventually. But that would take so much work, way too much for me. How could someone like me achieve something so big, when I get tired just from performing tasks required to live? I am almost tired 24/7. Wake up, get out of bed, eat food, maybe take a shower. Ok, I've had enough for the day already. I've already realized that in the end, anything that I accomplish in life won't mean anything. When I die, everything that I did in my life won't matter anymore. It might matter to the people that were entangled in my timeline, but eventually they will figure out the same thing, so it's fine, they will stop caring as well. Wherever darkness manifests itself, there is still light. I still want to enjoy my life here on earth, and in fact, I do sometimes. I still really care about the people close to me. The feeling of love is what stops me from ending it. I wish that I didn't have to feel this way, but I'm still a human. It pains me that some people care about me, because they really shouldn't. If they knew how I felt, I'm sure it would pain them. I wish others didn't need to feel pain. I know that this is definitely not normal, but sometimes I feel that my goal is to save everyone from this inevitable suffering.

I never had many friends and because I was a social outcast in my youth I am now at the age of 21 with fuck all friends.

I started taking meds and I didn’t notice much difference, so I stopped and made a conscious effort to try to better myself. I started dressing well, started having a hair and skincare routine and exercising and eating right. I’ve put on a decent amount of muscle and I look the best I have ever. For the first time in my life I’ve noticed women looking at me and smiling as I make eye contact with them and smile back. I’m not a bad looking person even though for years I very much felt I was and neglected to care for myself as a result. Despite the validation of seeing these good looking women notice me for the first time ever, it is all in vain. All of my efforts are futile as we walk by each other never to see each other again. I’m not even afraid to talk to women like I used to be, as I have a lot more confidence these days. I feel as though my sudden confidence around women is tied to the fact that I’m just numb and so over it all. All of the effort I put into myself is in vain because nothing ever happens. It was easier when I didn’t take care of myself, didn’t shower, eat or sleep.

54,"Hey Everyone, just wanted to share this quick mindset with you! Did you know out of the \~30,000 average thoughts a person has a day, 80% are negative and 95% are repetitive? As a result, our minds begin to automatically, and subconsciously have negative thoughts. Cognitive Behavioral Therapists call this “Automatic Negative Thoughts” This leads to stress, anxiety and fear.. A great way to help this is by adopting the mindset “treat yourself like you treat your best-friend. A great starting point is to reframe any negative thoughts you have about yourself. Instead of “I’m not smart enough to do this”, try “I’ve already learned so much, and will continue to learn. This has been shown to boost both your health and happiness.. Put simply, If you wouldn’t say it to your best-friend, don’t say it to yourself. Hope this helped you!",0,well_being_reddit_body

60,"For the longest time, I've remembered crying freely when needed. This crying could be in response to sadness, fear, or anger, but now that I am in highschool, I can't seem to cry unless I am talking to someone. The issue here is that I don't want to cry in front of anyone. I wish I could cry alone without the discomfort and guilt of doing it in front of someone. Instead, when I am going through something that i feel like I should cry about, all I can muster is a blank stare into space. As I stare I begin losing awareness of my environment while I become increasingly anxious and existential. Why does my brain substitute brain spotting for crying? If this is healthy, then why does it feel so frustrating and unnatural? This is not to say I am frustrated whilst staring off, because I am actually very comfortable in this state of numbness and hyperactive thought. It is before and after the fact that I become angry and increasingly sad at the fact that I can't have that hormonal relief that comes with crying.",1,well_being_reddit_body

I called them and told them it was bullshit and they said I need to send my first passport that held my permanent residency (from when I was a baby). This seems incredibly illogical because I was in a similar situation last year that required me to hold my residence class visa for atleast 3 years aswell and that had gotten approved. The only difference now is that my passport is renewed. The student loan process can take up to a month and there is simply no way that it will be approved within a week before the start date of the university (which is when the fees are due). I am now forced to pay out of pocket, which I can only afford for the first semester and that will deplete my entire savings account. Furthermore, if my student loan doesn't get processed in time for the second semester, I'm forced to drop out and work. Which seems very likely if THIS is a hiccup in their system.

107,"As many of you may be aware, there has been an ongoing problem of student suicides on university and college campuses. Many universities have chosen to stay silent of this issue and have not taken enough measures to try to improve the situation and to offer more accessible resources to their students. In light of this problem, I would like to share the following video to everyone as a reminder, again, that it is okay to speak up, it is okay to talk about mental health issues and it is okay to share your thoughts, feelings and challenges. What you think and how you feel - your emotions and thoughts - are valid and important. Even for just a bit, Wish I Knew would like play a role to help students through providing additional resources and a platform that can reach many and that can be comfortable for many to access.

108,"I've always been depressed to some degree since I was very young. I knew there was something wrong with my brain, but whenever I tried to ask my parents for help or to see someone about it, they would brush it off. Now though, years and years later, I do see a psychiatrist and I'm in therapy, but I hit an excruciating swing of depression for the past few weeks. I can't stop thinking about how much I've screwed up my life, how many people I've disappointed, how the things I've done and been through are impossible to come back from. I've lost weight at an extreme speed because I can't gather the motivation to go make myself something to feed myself, or really the motivation to do anything. I think about death a lot. How it could just end this whole cycle. Every minute just drags on and it's messing with my perception of time. And I'm just so TIRED of sleeping, not wanting to do anything but sleep, but then feeling like a failure for not getting anything done. I have a couple friends who check up on me, but I feel like I don't deserve them. I don't wanna bring their mood down, it doesn't feel like I'm being a good friend back.

They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes.

I feel like I don’t deserve happiness or friendship and if I do have a moment of joy, I’ll feel guilty or undeserving shortly after. I’ll even feel like I deserve bad things to happen to me be that deserving an anxiety attack or physical pain. My anxiety isn’t getting any better either. I constantly have a feeling of impending doom, I’m constantly aware of my being and life will often feel like I’m watching a movie, just a series of events I’m not actually experiencing. I’m a trans guy and I want to transition but that desire is slowly dissolving. I feel like I should just stop trying because I have no hope left that the future will be better. I don’t feel real and I don’t feel like I’m ‘trans enough’ and I feel pathetic. I feel judged by *everyone* and I cannot ‘be myself’ because I don’t know who that person is. But I really don’t want to give up. Despite having no hope left, there are still things I want to see. I may not have any goals, but what I do have are small wishes. Small wishes like the wish to walk through a beautiful park on a sunny day with no worries, the wish to sit on a roof and look at stars or to eat at an all night diner with friends and just laugh. I think about these things a lot. I want to live long enough to actually *be there* I never thought I’d be at this point. I’ve told people that they didn’t have to worry because I’d never get low enough to think about suicide now that feels like so long ago.

My stomach was really bloated and my back was killing me as I was taking a cpa exam, I’ve wanted to go to the hospital several times but my parents talked me out of it.

I’ll try to keep specifics to a minimum as my social circle browses the subreddit occasionally and isn’t something I’m currently sharing with all of them. A short backstory Ever since high school I’ve suffered from various severities of depression, this peaked in 2018/2019 when I attempted to take my own life on two occasions and (luckily) failed both times without serious repercussions health wise. Fast forward a year or two, I have a child with a woman who I am no longer with, and fatherhood has been absolutely amazing. I know it’s cliche, but it really is life changing. I wouldn’t give it up for anything. While things have been mostly civil with coparenting as you can imagine issues arise more often than with a couple who is together. I’ve really tried to let things roll off and keep things as positive as I can for the kiddos sake, but the last couple months those old feelings have started to sneak back in - especially when there is some kind of conflict with the mother. I find myself in a very guilt ridden situation, I feel awful whenever the thoughts of taking my life creep back in especially when I am a father now. I always push them down out of pure guilt for thinking them, because I love my child and cannot imagine life away/without them. In a lot of ways, it’s worse than before because I always told myself I had a way out - and I feel like I do not have that option anymore (rightly). Has anyone else dealt with this?

It is all an unbelievable amount of material being required, and I do not truly feel like I can manage it. To make matters worse, I am currently right on the line between letter grades. Doing well on my finals will pull me up, and doing poorly will keep me down. I would not normally be so stressed about finals, but they are a kind of ""make it or break it"" thing at this point, especially because certain colleges require my first semester transcript. I just finished applying to the honors program at the college I will most likely be attending, but I have been so swamped with work all the rest of my life that I'm not even sure I even want to embark on something else challenging. I hear college is the place you make all your true friends, ""find yourself,"" and everything else like that. I just fail to even comprehend this idea because all school has ever posed is stress. It feels like all my LIFE has ever posed is stress. Anyone who survived a rigorous and stressful high school experience, please tell me I'm going to make it. I expect the best of myself and hate myself when I can't deliver. I lose my head when I get too stressed, and I don't even feel like I know what I'm doing anymore.",1,well_being_reddit_body

It's like intentionally trying to put blinders on. I'm trying to stay in reality because, in this case, my stress is caused by my long distance fiance getting a job near me, and moving her and myself into an apartment. One element of this is that her family is very much a planning one. My family is very much of a ""get it done asap"" type deal. Whereas she wants a three week process, I'd rather just get it done.

By now, we already have an apartment we wanted to buy - settled on the price (488k) which was a steal in a city-fringe location. so now we have a buyer who's still interested in buying our house - and they offered $360k without the extension, because their own extension on their current house is expiring soon too. parents accept the offer, and tell me and my sister. rendering us homeless in 3 months because the new house has to undergo renovation for a few months starting october(most likely complete in jan 2022). continuing in comments because my phone is lagging out due to the word count.",1,well_being_reddit_body

Anyway, I am almost 27, but I can't help but feel like I'm going on 72. This isn't exactly a bad thing, but realistically my life feels like it is never going to change in any major or meaningful way ever again. I graduated from college and can't afford more education, nor I don't have enough money to even save up for a home. I do have enough to split the cost of a cozy apartment with my partner (which we do) and we intend to remain child free, however we do have a lovely cat. Honestly, it feels like the only other major thing we could do is get married, and even if we did, we wouldn't make it some grand ordeal. We'd probably, quite literally just go to city hall together, and then maybe go out for a nice lunch and call it a wedding. Please note that neither of us want it to be a big deal for many reasons and what I described would actually be ideal if we ever did even get married. Outside of that, I don't really even have any talents, hobbies, passions or interests that I really find interesting enough to pursue further. Athough I'm content with that, it just adds to the atmosphere of stagnation. But what fun is it forcing yourself to get good at something if you have no interest or motivation to do so? I also don't have many friends, nor do I enjoy being around people or crowds very much, but even if I did, I don't think the odds of me randomly meeting some dear new friend that will magically change my life forever are very high. I'm used to friends walking away from me after a while actually, and only really have one or two friendships that have stood the test of time. I guess the last thing worth mentioning is that I love travelling, but it's really hard to afford that and fit it in, plus you can't really go far right now due to the Delta variant.

I tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes. It was amazing I met some great friends. I started eating healthier. I did everything I could to take my mind off it.

I am really close to losing her because I am just not good at being emotional support for her. Since school started in February, she works part time 25 hours a week while taking 19 credits as a STEM major, and contributes to a sorority. She has no time for anything and has just been so overwhelmed. She gets about 4 hours of sleep a night and is falling behind in her classes. Every night she has panic attacks and is just so insanely stressed and a lot of the times she says she can't do life and says she is going to kill herself. Our relationship is semi-long distance. I am able to visit her every other week and be able to spend time with her for 6 days. I feel I am a lot better at being emotional support for her in person rather than over text or over the phone. She tells me that I am making it harder for her mentally because I am just really bad at talking her through it. She also says that I give her more stress because when I talk to her I make her feel bad that she is behind in her classes. Our relationship is on thin ice and she keeps telling me that we are not going to make it. I potentially have Covid so I will not be able to see her for a while. I am just looking for some advice on how to talk to her. I am in love with this girl and I just always see past the mentally hurt girl.

235,"Stress makes me ill. They do not pay me enough to make me ill. Over the years I have stuck to some basic rules. They may already be on /r/stress. Anyway, it is good to share. Negative stress is a term I heard used for things that you have no way of controlling/fixing/moving forward. This type of stress is a killer. If you find yourself dealing with negative stress, tell your boss. You don't work for your boss, your boss works for you. It is their job to make sure you can do yours. The higher up in a company someone works, the more people they work for. Delegate your problems upwards. If you can see a way to de-stress your boss - do it! A stressed boss is hard to delegate to. Positive stress is facing the challenge of doing things that you MIGHT be able to achieve (at least it is in my vocabulary). Positive stress is still stress, although some people get such a kick from it they actually create stressful situations. Avoid these people. I do my best to see problems as challenges. When you have things to do, and you find the sheer volume or complexity daunting, break the job down. I am talking ticking things off. Lists. For quantity, tick off every time you have dealt with X amount of doodahs. For complexity, break the job into smaller tasks, and tick them off as you go. Starting can be the hardest thing - so get ticking as soon as you can. Remember, you can only eat an elephant one bite at a time. EDIT And never break down your day into hours to tick off.

I have always had lots of friends and surrounded by people as much as I want to be, but I cannot shake this voice in my head. If people invite me out I tell myself its because they want me to drive, they want to crash at my place after, they want to use my pool. They do nothing to give me this feeling yet my mind tries to convince me. I am 24 and never been in a relationship. Every time a girl has shown interest in me, I turn them away. They sleepover and I don't make a move, then they ask why I didn't and I do not have an answer. In my head of course I do not feel good enough to make a move, I fear rejection even though I know I wouldn't be rejected. I have turned down probably 10-15 girls in the past two years alone. It makes me feel dumb.. I sit here lonely yet reject everyone that comes my way. It is self-sabotage. How can I ever progress when this voice convinces me otherwise. I went to a club recently and had to leave. I looked around at everyone having a good time and happy and I was standing there feeling like an ogre in a mix with all king and queens.

Work is always on my mind, I struggle to complete the things I need to do as I find it really hard to concentrate. My motivation just isn't there.

She turned around a yelled,”You don’t have to rush me!” And went back to doing what she was working on, clearly angry. I had no response and could only stammer that I wasn’t rushing her and finally gave up and went inside and sat on the couch to figure out what had just happened.

267,"The mind can turn the body's pH from acidic to alkaline in a matter of minutes. Stress can adversely affect the genetic makeup in your body; the mind can positively or negatively affect DNA. One of the fastest and easiest to feel, method to counteract stress, comes from a natural reaction that our physical body has to us having consistent/strong enough positive thoughts. Whether from positive memories, thanking God, thinking about your future plans, someone you love, inspiring or moving moments in life/movies/songs. Really consider the fact that from just thinking certain positive thoughts your whole physical body can get chills all over it or just in certain locations (for now). If you take time to notice you will find that your self induced positive chills have an accompanying sort of wave underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot). After researching what that specific current underneath the skin is I came across a sort of *energy* we have that is tied to our spirit. I've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force and many more. Now consider this if you can truly induce that feel good occurence at will, you can definitely use it to counteract feelings of stress. If you would like to know how to take control of that energy and how to, at will, stop that paralyzing feeling of stress on it's track.

In March it was the last time I saw my mother because of a stupid thing I did and that every day makes me feel guilty.

Also, after it finished (it didn't last long like it felt like 20secs) i was completely conscious with my eyes closed, thinking if i think of good thoughts, and regenerate it again, it will have a different feeling. Weird right. But this is not the first time it happened to me. It happened in a same stress period a year ago. Hopefully guys you can help me figure out it's name, cause I really wanna know if it's harmful. If you experienced the same thing let me know red_heart ",1,well_being_reddit_body

At this point, my suicidal thoughts only got worse and worse, to the point I actually pointed a knife to my neck, honestly thinking whether I should push in or pull away, but I'm too much of a coward to actually do anything. I've decided to check a few old texts and saw that my girlfriend sent me a text. I don't think it's in my right to share what it said in public, but... While she didn't say it explicitly, it's heavily implied that she cheated on me. And I can't help but think about how much this hurts. So I asked what the fuck she meant by that, and all I can do now is wait for an answer and hope that I'm just a bad person to even think that she did that, and that she didn't do what I think she did. And now, I'm here, in the middle of class, thinking what the fuck is the point of all of this, just wishing I didn't wake up at all today just so I wouldn't feel all this pain.

Now, I enjoy watching him play, I really do. It's pretty entertaining most times. But sometimes he plays games that just aren't as interesting for me to watch. But have I ever told him that? No. Why? Because I love hearing him talk. He gets excited about this game and will narrate his actions as he plays. He will start talking nonstop, either to me or just to himself, and gets more animated as the night goes on. Half of the time I understand it, but the other half I'm completely lost. It's very confusing and because of that I don't get as immersed. But the reason I keep asking him to stream his game for me, is because I love listening to him talk about it.

When you are an adult you have money and energy but no time. When you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones. Life is always out of balance to kick you down.

372,"About 2 years ago, I started having terrible stomach pains all the time, which were usually worsened by any kind of stress that I faced throughout the day. Last year, my father became very worried about this, and decided to take me to the doctor to see what could be causing it. My bowel movements were regular, I avoided foods that I was allergic to, and the doctor could not find anything wrong. But I did not mention my stress to her at the time. After this visit, I took a blood test and an ultrasound, but I seemed to be in perfect health. Then, we saw a GI doctor, and I finally decided to ask if my stress levels were part of the cause of my stomach pain. After I explained the situation a little more, he told me that my issues were definitely stress related, and that I should visit a psychiatrist. He also advised me to start taking therapy. I actually used to take therapy for something other than stress. I had been regularly engaging in self harm, and fallen into the deep pits of depression about a year before my stomach pains had started. So when my father found out, he asked me to start taking therapy. It worked great, and I loved going, but I think we all know that therapy is pretty expensive. My father has a good, stable job, and is paid well enough, but my mother doesn't have a job and he has two children. We try not to spend too much money, but continuing to get therapy on his salary is just impossible. So I stopped taking therapy after we moved cities. My father started getting paid around $20,000 more per year after the move, and we started living in an area where rent is much more reasonable. A few months ago, my father told me that he wanted me to start taking therapy again if my stomach pain would not go away. But I knew that he would still have a difficult time affording it. I also knew that he was having a hard time sleeping at night because of the stress that I was causing him. I love my father a lot, and I don't want to trouble him any more than I already do.

My wife and I are okay - sometimes. Sometimes I think she's sick of me. She wants to stay involved in their lives - I like their company and I love them - but I want them to do it all on their own. So, she and I fight about that. Like I said - other than the pain of dying, I'm not really too happy about sticking around here either.",1,well_being_reddit_body

He's been down to his last $200 in a foreign country before and managed to find a job before his money ran out, so i guess his lack of stress was justified. He tells me all the time that I shouldn't be stressed so much because there's no point in doing so. On the other hand, I stress about everything because I feel that if I'm not stressing, I won't be prepared for when something unexpected happens. Like if I have a leaking pipe and need to spend thousands fixing the damage. How do you not feel the urgent need to make sure you have enough money to prepare for something like that? What's normal? Is it normal to be stressed every day? Or is it normal to not be stressed unless something big is about to occur?

389,"So where do I start, this year has been rough from a failed coming out to covid to a life changing breakup. While life has been pretty shitty for my mental health today was a sign of happiness. Living with my parents has been rough since I’ve been having to fake being straight and just hide being gay. But today I got to see my amazing boyfriend, and yes we’re both closeted and we met on grindr. However despite it being hard for both of us we make it work and honestly I’ve never loved someone as much before. I’ve never gotten happy over someone else’s accomplishments before. I’ve never loved someone no matter if they get a new tattoo or piercing. But he changes all of that. But back to today. I was able to talk to my aunt who I haven’t seen in a while, she doesn’t know I’m gay but loves me a lot. We was talking about moving out for me and we talked about how hard it will be for my parents. But we finally both agreed that it kinda has to happen one day and what’s a better time than now. Fast forward to a few hours later after I saw my bf I was talking to my dad about the idea and I’ve never mentioned it till now and was so worried because they hate the idea of me leaving them. If it was up to them I’d live with them forever. But he took it rather well. I told him it’s not like I’d move far away legit just like 10 minutes away from our house. And while he hated it he understood to an extent. It just made me super happy because while it’s just a small step it gives me hope that one day I’ll be able to be truly happy and free. My mom however that’s gonna be a true battle but I’ll wait for another day for that. If someone told me in March when I was not eating for weeks and just crying every night that I’d have an amazing boyfriend and an actual chance at being able to be an adult I’d think you was crazy.

We didn't know this at the time - we only found out months later and it came as a shock because we had no idea he even had a drug problem to begin with. Anyway, his death caused a massive ripple effect in our family and being his oldest son I have had to step into some big shoes. I found myself caught in between drama involving my dad's mom and my own mom, while also having to be there for my younger brother (19). My parents owned a restaurant and following my dad's death the building landlord forced us out because he wanted the building for himself. So after learning the results of the toxicology report, we had to scramble to close the restaurant down and get out of the building before the landlord tried suing us again. To help my mom with the restaurant closing I had to leave my job (which I hated anyway) and now I am applying to dental school (another very involved and stressful process) while looking for a new job. Long story short, I just feel like there are a lot of people depending on me all the time now and it feels like a lot of pressure. I constantly feel as though I am behind the eight ball and with each passing day I get more and more stressed out. I am just worried that if I can't handle this type of pressure now, how will I juggle a career and a family of my own on top of all this.

That’s when she told me I may have mild depression, which really shocked and saddened me because I had never thought I had depression.

I had completed everything on time, received high marks, and worked extremely hard on my projects. Same goes with my internship. But now school and my internship are over and I feel lost, hopeless, and like time is running out for me to do something successful with my life.

It works by attacking your nerves and slowly over time will paralyze you. Well that’s what most people get, some loose sight,hearing,taste,ability to swallow or talk, and all felling. Less then ten percent get that bad but considering that my dad is at the point most people get at in 20 years done in 2 hes probably going to get that bad. Well he would have if he did’t make a decision. I support what he’s going to do just because I don’t want him in That personal hell. He is going to kill him self before he gets that bad…. I live with him so I can see him getting worse by the day and I’m scared that day might be getting close. I am the only one living with him in fact. I’m staying till his end because there’s no one else who is willing to help so even if I wanted to leave I can’t. He’s lucky I love him so much or I would be ubset over this. I’m more so ubset that no one else really even wants to help. Leaving a 16 year old to take care of his father. Helping him up, cleaning cooking, hell Iv gotten used to wipeing him.

Second, I've suffered from pretty extreme anxiety for pretty much my whole life, but it's only really been the last 2-3 years I've suffered from the kind of symptoms you would generally associate with bad depression. And the last week has sent me over the edge in both regards. I'm falling behind in college even though it's a subject I should, and do, love. I feel my a few of my teachers are complete assholes, and events in my life during the last week have really put me down. Between all that, I'm honestly having a panic attack right now about class this morning. To be honest, the events of the last week turned my depression into the realm of suicide ideation. I hate to say that, but I have thought about it. I had to take my father to the hospital, and I didn't know if he was going to come back. And then my mother found stuff which didn't paint him in a great light. I've felt like complete crap ever since. I'm calling a doctor today after class today, and I'm going to get help. I don't want to live like this, and I can't. I can't keep feeling the way I do, because I know it is a path to self-destruction, and I don't know if it's me specifically or the rest of the world or a combination.

The moment keeps replaying in my head and I keep coming up with solutions to the situation. Like, what if I killed us 3? What if I hurt other people exiting? What if everyone’s scared of driving with me again? What if I hit someone, or someone hit me? What if there wasn’t any road right there? What could’ve happened because of my stupidity?

And in Turkey it's also so stressful in these times for people because all the thing is depended on a single exam we do end of the year ( literally a single one day test we take ). Whether thinking about it or life I find myself always being sad because of a certain thing and I can't remember all of them in one tho. I feel like I'm not growing or I didn't grew at all I'm shorter than my coevals. My penis size is embarrassingly small. And in this young age I have a visually perceivable hair loss. I don't know. Tonight I'm sad with my hairs and that's why I decided to write. And I don't know what you people can help with but. I just feel sad and shitty. Maybe hair can be cured but I don't know anything about it tho. They started falling when I grew em longer than usually I use, and when I cutted them again they just didn't stop to. Now when I look into mirror and see baldy parts I hate my life. And I know this stress just makes everything worse but I want to have a normal penis, a not falling hair ( at least at my fucking 17th year ) and a nice college life but it seems I'm far far away from all of these.

I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything.

466,"Hi, I've honestly been suicidal for like 20 years. I am 30 now. I can't imagine a life where suicide isn't an option. I can't imagine getting better. I decided to be slightly more honest with my therapist and im going to be going for partial hospitalization soon. So, due to having many mental illnesses, I have been on a LOT of meds, some of which were on a trial basis... and I have kept them all. I have enough of one particular med to kill myself. I am not currently on this med and it is not useful to me in any way besides killing myself. I cannot imagine myself ever willingly getting rid of my stash. I obviously haven't told my care team I have it. I've had it since 2014 when I stopped that particular med. It will still work even though it's old. Like, I feel like I NEED that out. So, when/if I get better, do you think I would be willing to get rid of it? Honestly the thought of that is scary and makes me not want to get better. I need the out. I know there are other ways to go, but this is the method I have chosen, that i am most comfortable with for various reasons. If im honest with my care team and tell them about it, and that I refuse to get rid of it even though there have been a few times this month I was seriously considering using it, will I be stuck in a hospital until I commit to throwing my stash away? I KNOW that by having it here I am in danger. I don't care, I need it. I mean I've had it for years without using it so I'm pretty safe I think, usually. I am not even sure if it's possible for me to get better. I can't imagine a life without suicidal ideation. I can't imagine not needing an out. What do y'all think?",1,well_being_reddit_body

Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much. So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness.

For me I was in the 7th grade the first time the corona virus was brought up and we went on lockdown. During does first 6 months as I had my summer break to I played video games constantly with my friends from the uk as that was where I use to live and I was feeling great at the time because any kid at that age would love to not go to school for 6 months, but whilst does months were going by I started realizing how unproductive my daily routine was and how bad my social skills were getting. By this time I was in the 8th grade and now we actually had to do online school. The only thing is me being in my room 24-7 for 6 months straight not doing anything but playing games and eating made my numbness way worse. At this point I started not caring about life anymore and instead of living it would just feel like I’m existing in a dead corpse. It got so bad that I cheated on every online work I got and I did not feel bad at all and I still don’t. Even when I had to go in person to do my final exams I knew i was gonna fail them but still didn’t care. Now I’m a freshman in highschool and I honestly can’t see myself doing anything but working at a fast food restaurant once I finish school. Bring abled to make friends has gotten so as to the point where I find it hard to speak to new people online. To be honest highschool isn’t the worst I’m glad I get to go in person because it’s forcing me to speak to people however I’ve spoke to people about this depression and a lot of people say it is because of COVID however I haven’t seen much people talk about it here.

Then I had my one friend who was mine and only mine. She got a boyfriend near the end of high school as well though. We were still close, but I rarely saw her. Then they broke up two years ago, and we’ve been super close for the past two years. Until recently. She got a new boyfriend and I hardly see her or talk to her anymore. My sister who I’ve always been close with has a long term boyfriend too, and I’m considered the third wheel to their relationship so I don’t hang out with them much either. One of my friends from high school who I cut off recently got back in touch with me and we’ve been getting close again. But about a month ago she got a new boyfriend and I haven’t talked to her since. Another of my friends just moved a 20 hour drive away for school.

I have both an autoimmune disorder (lupus) and currently dealing with major depression. The combination of the two means that I deal with lots of fatigue, and that a lot of times I don't really strongly feel like doing much of anything, though I do force myself to get outside and I'm functional enough to I take care of the basic needs like daily hygiene and buying and making food for myself. Recently it has just been feeling very oppressive. I'm in sort of a paradoxical position where I wish I wasn't all alone all the time (I don't really have any local friends) yet the depression keeps me from wanting to go and hang out with people. I have anhedonia which means I don't really feel positive emotions such as joy and love, but I am able to feel negative emotions such as frustration, hurt, and anger. I struggle with self hate and when its at its worst I feel like I hate almost everyone. I've been living in the same small town city now for about 15 years. I know it wouldn't cure my depression but honestly a lot of times I wish I could just see different scenery. I'm currently working on my master's in teaching, when I first started out I felt on top of the world, and then right after my first semester the major depression hit after a mental breakdown. Being on medication has helped and I've been able to get better since the initial breakdown, but now I'm left worrying how am I going to have the motivation to make it through the rest of the program. I'm tired and sometimes all I want to do is just sleep.",1,well_being_reddit_body

I’m in Med school, abroad, and am embroiled in trying to earn a few more points on a major exam so that I can attend my sister’s wedding, which is to be held in the States. The exam I failed has a make up, but it is literally scheduled the day after the wedding, so to travel back abroad still means I would have to miss out on the occasion, which itself can’t be delayed any further. I know that I am not the strongest of students, but I really felt confident with the particular exam, and now because of my own damn fault I may be withheld from going. I just feel like I’m letting everyone down, like I’m just destined to keep failing. It’s hard to talk to people close to me on this matter, despite me doing so, because it just goes back into this loop of “you did this to yourself, you need to dedicate more time to studying, etc.” I don’t disagree with the feedback, but it’s not helping me right now. I just feel trapped. Update well, I tried. I went to the University office, and it was such a farce. They stopped any conversation saying “Their hands are tied,” or “we are legally bound from doing ...”, including providing the answer key to said exam so that I could see where the points were lost. I won’t be attending my sister’s wedding, and will have to sit in for the make up exam. I never minded sitting for the exam, it’s just the timing of it all. I could go on about how pathetic the scheduling system is, how I can’t even access the exam admit card until a few days prior to the exam, but it’s not going to do me any good.

My at the time girlfriend was devastated, my father was a wreck, my mother acted cold to me, and the whole school found out that their thoughts on “that crazy asshole” may have been justified. It’s been almost 3 years since then and I’ve seen therapists twice since. The part I hate the most about therapists is how you can’t have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die. When they ask “Do you have thoughts of suicide?” or “have you made plans of suicide?” I know I have to answer “No” because if I’m honest and say “Yes. This is my plan” then I’m going to get thrown back into the Psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety” If I can’t be 100% honest with the person that’s supposed to help me, then how am I supposed to get any help.

My issue is that I don’t want to admit I have suicidal thoughts to anyone, not even the doctor I’m visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information. I also can’t go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms, I feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt I’ve made in the past. My parents are, for the most part, homeopathic and I’m listed as a dependent under their insurance plan. I’m both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense… (E.g. only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated.) I’m no longer a minor, but I still live with them and I can’t drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as I’m mentally crippled nor do I have friends to help me. My doctor’s visit is under the guise of fainting from frequent migraines (which is true). My parents are paying for it, and fortunately, they can’t tell the difference between a neurologist and a psychiatrist in case of a referral. I’m planning to bring up depression to the doctor at the same time and will use all personal part-time money to pay for whatever else. But will diagnosis or treatment change if I omit important facts like suicide? I want to quickly get better, focus, and leave this place. I can’t afford be locked up by my parents. I know next to nothing about going to the doctor’s. So maybe none of this is a valid concern…?",1,well_being_reddit_body

578,"Good Day. I just got promoted to a brand new section at work. I went from being the top producer in my division to going over to a completely new division and I started in a supervisory role. I’m very lost. I know generally about what I’m supposed to be doing, but I feel like such a disappointment because I can’t answer my employees questions. Every single thing I see is brand new to me and I get so stressed out because I have a limited support system of people to ask questions to. Everyone is working from home so I can’t even have the luxury of learning a little bit by walking around and interacting with my people. I like the people, but a lot of them are low performers so I have to start with corrective actions before too long. All the other supervisory roles are vacant so I’m doing work for 3 teams. And my boss is new as well so I can’t really go to her, because she doesn’t know the answer either. I’m so stressed and every single day I get about 20 small fires I need to put out and several large fires and I have no idea how to solve any of them. Nobody has offered any training materials or support so I have had to find them all myself. The worst part is I put in for a supervisory position in my own division, but I was pulled over to this team because there were so many vacancies. So I have to do admin work for a huge team, start hiring processes, start performance appraisals (Despite me only being there 2 weeks), I sign off on all their work (I don’t know for sure if they’re doing everything right, but I simply don’t have the time to check everything and ask questions about everything), I get escalated all of the tough things and I get all the heat when things aren’t going great. Bottom line, I am so stressed out and every day after work I cry because I feel so terrible and I just sit there sad and eating unhealthy food because my energy has been sucked and my motivation is gone.

So I took some Xanax to help relax me but still couldn’t do it. I ended up calling my boyfriend and he came to get everything. Right now only 2 people know and I’m really low. He took all of my weapons and my pills. I still think about an escape but I know I can’t do anything. I’m trying to do better but it’s hard. I still wake up wishing I did it.,1,well_being_reddit_body

We met up and decided to stay in the car and get coffee as it was raining. We parked in a quiet spot next to a river and talked while listening to music and drinking our coffee. I then told her I really liked her and she said she did too. We gazed at each others' eyes and I looked down very briefly at her lips, so did she. We went for the kiss and made out for quite a while. I was like 'that was nice', and we dit it again! She laid her head on my shoulder and the feeling that gave me was literally out of this world. We decided to go for a little highway cruise while listening to music and talking and she held my hand the entire time. I dropped her back off home after 2 hours and a half and we kissed twice again. We hugged and she told me she didn't want to let go. A month before this I felt like a total loser for never having even touched a girls hand and look at me now, I feel like a million bucks.

621,"Hey everyone, I just joined the group and I think I should share a relatively good breakthrough I had with my stress management. I work a grueling job as an essential worker at a grocery chain in the midwestern US. This job has really seen me go through the ringer in regards to bending over backwards to make my company happy. We are the number one store for sales in the company, and one of the ways we are number one is through our online ordering where we seem to have a “no ceiling rule” where we with accept X number of orders per hour. To where, around thanksgiving. We were doing easily 30-40 orders a half hour (roughly 10 containers to hold items/order). Couple that with me being the pallet puller who pulls all the orders out to where we let people drive up for their order. Couple it with a thankless job where they’re only using me for my size. It gets to be stressful. Anyhow, last night I cracked and I decided to start medicating with OTC stress relievers. So I bought some of that Ashwagandha stuff or whatever and took one about 6 PM last night (two hours after my shift) and it was amazing. I didn’t feel quite as stressed, and as someone who lives naturally with a lot of stress/frustration (due to a Spectrum Disorder) and a high stress job, I felt honestly the best I have felt since maybe before COVID-19 took over our lives. Honestly, I hope to leave the job soon due to the stress causing me a lot mental struggles outside of work.

Since you are all interested in stress here, I thought you might be interested in participating in the project. Info is below. Thanks so much! Our laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh is conducting a research study to measure how people experience **stress**. If you are a US citizen or resident between the ages of 18-65 years old, you are eligible to participate! The study involves filling out some questionnaires about how stress manifests itself in your body. Depending on your unique stress response, the survey could take as little as 5 minutes or up to approximately 15 minutes to complete. To compensate you for completing the survey, you can choose to have your name entered for the opportunity to receive an iPad. You may also elect to do the survey as a volunteer without compensation (i.e., without having your name entered to receive an iPad). Some respondents may be invited to fill out the survey a second time at a later date and will again have the opportunity to receive compensation.

It clearly affects him some days so we talk and I try to understand what can be done to reduce the pressure. It’s not an excessive work load situation, the pressure to complete is largely self imposed. We are not an organization that blames people nor has this employee ever experienced consequences for missing an problem or timeline. He just seems to get hung up when there are lots of little follow-ups nagging at him. I’ve encouraged him to be mindful of the stress and try to reprogram himself to have a more positive outlook of each problem that comes up. After all, we view this role as somewhat of a savior organizationally... why dread the inevitable? Design bugs are part of the process. Just today he was in my office venting about how manly people he was waiting on for input and I encouraged him to make lists of open items each morning rather than carry them around for the day in him head.

706,I’m currently 17 which I know is young but I just can’t seem to find any sort of hope for me to carry on and continue living. I feel as though I can’t catch a break it’s just continuous L after another like I’ve hit rock bottom but the ground gives way and I fall down even further. I used to get along with everyone but either the people I have trusted no longer want to talk to me or the friends I have now are just dickheads who make me feel like I’m not cared and that I’m a piece of shit but I only choose to hangout with them cause they are all they I have left in terms of people to talk to. Doesn’t help either that a girl I loved has abandoned me after telling her how I felt and whom I thought was the only person I could go to for help when I was down. She has made me more upset as she knew what I was going through with my depression and loneliness but she still left me. I’ve also had to give up some activities like my favourite sport baseball because I wasn’t mentally fit to play anymore and would have breakdowns on the bench or lash out at my teammates when they got on me for something because I didn’t do something right. Worst part is that when I left the team has played better without me making me feel even shittier than I was to begin with. I’m currently in therapy and am on meds but I can’t help about how I want to die so badly or harming myself whenever I get the chance. As someone who is in desperate need of help what would you do if you were me.,1,well_being_reddit_body

I have to fly across the country on my own, where I’ll meet the group of strangers who I’ll be spending the next five months with. This on its own is very, very stressful. I have social anxiety, and I’ll have to leave my family (the longest I’ve been away from my parents is a week). But because I’m leaving in early January, this meant finishing all my classes early. I barely studied over the winter break. I did two tests today, which I think I did okay on. But I have all my exams tomorrow, plus another test. I’m screwed.

I’m bound to end up with a very poor grade, which is in biology, the path I want to pursue in university. How the hell can I imagine getting into university if I can’t even do okay in the high school class? I only identified the issue I’ve been struggling with as being stress a couple days ago. I said before then “ugh I’m stressed out” and whatever, but I didn’t know what that really meant until now. It took a while for me to link the racing mind, insomnia, gastrointestinal troubles, racing heartbeat, restlessness, diffuse concentration, low cognitive performance, disorganization, forgetfulness, and low immune system as all stemming from the same issue until then.

She said that the image of child me living in constant emotional abuse and neglect for almost 18 years broke her heart. After I went home, I cried too. I’ve forgotten that I shouldn’t be used to it, and that it is okay for me to cry, to feel sorrow for the child who was once me.

It's not that I want be lazy, no, it's that I have no inclination to do anything in particular and that I know I'll most likely feel disappointed if I DO force myself to do anything because it won't be fulfilling and all I'll be left with is a confirmed inability to enjoy things. I don't want to be sitting in my room alone doing nothing, but I'm too tired to be outside doing something.

755,"Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it. I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*. If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation. It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different. More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore? Edit Thank you for all the comments.

Now covid has been stressful but my management has caused me more stress than covid has. I’m a part timer on a full time line. That means that I have set shifts and hours. My line was Monday to Friday with weekends off. I was working in a covid unit and then was moved to icu to deal with cleaning covid in there. Through that my hours did not change. As soon as summer season started they decided to change my schedule to every other weekend off. The catch there, I was the only one who had their schedule changed like that. Management stated it was because of overtime, however there has been no overtime being offered. On top of that, I have been trying to now get them to switch my rotation of every other weekend off to accommodate my life. I’m in a serious relationship and with this new schedule my partner and I have literally no days off. I addressed it with my management and they refuse to do anything about it. So now my summer is ruined. I also brought this up to the union at my work and they did next to nothing about it. These issues mentioned above are literally the icing on the cake.

At the school I go to theres is a very unlikely chance I get playing time because I wasn’t recruited. And the junior year is the most important year for a student athlete.

That I'm indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that I'm ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit? Fuckin' hell, man. Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person. I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal. I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time. Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life. Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that."" I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit. Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this?

She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks. She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total. After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for?

She also asks me for suicide methods and basically asks me for advice on how to kill herself. I usually try to sit down and listen to her vent about why shes feeling that way but i feel like it never helps. I have also recommended the suicide hotline as another form of help bc i didnt know what to do.

I'm a young female marine, I tend to take care of myself, but recently I've got some things that just kinda..gnaw at me. Here's my stressors. -I am on on crutches currently due to multiple stress fractures in my foot. -My mother has some severe medical problems, her favorite dog is dying right now. She's very emotional and lives with my dad, who's a criminal at heart, he's a felon and gets in jail about twice a year. He's also very emotionally abusive -Im dealing with a very difficult MOS school, the atrittion rate is about half of the class fails every time. I won't be specific, but chemical warfare is hard. I may get recycled due to injury. -Ever since I got on crutches, the platoon avoids me like a plague. I can't ever call or ask anyone for help. Marines are tight knit, we're like a family, but I don't think I could depend on any of these people. Just this weekend not a single person would lend me a laptop to finish a course online so I wouldn't get dropped, but on my phone I could see all those same people on steam when they told me they were busy doing it too. I've gotten a lot of nasty comments about my crutches, people tend to use it to put me down. -im worries about my physical fitness if I'm gonna be out of commission so long. We have PFTs, CFTs and weight requirements to adhere to. I try to do upper body, and some other excercises, but doc tells me to take it easy, I feel like I can't.

I have always been a support system for her. And I thought I had seen her bad episodes (I knew her when she almost made an attempt) but I have never seen anything like this. Unfortunately we don’t live together any more but I try to visit or talk on the phone as much as possible and she changed. She is still honest to me about her symptoms for the most part which I appreciate as it makes it easier for me to help her but I don’t know what to. She has been suicidal the past three months, isolating her self from friends and family (only talking to me because I make her and that was hard to do) she hasn’t been eating and has been nearly fainting at work as a result, she has no regard for future consequences (she was fine with the potential of going to jail) she is not keeping up with basic life necessities and is completely reliant on her boyfriend to survive (it’s not an abusives relationship he really cares about her but I believe they may be codependent). She stated that her dissociation and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse so she decided to quit her meds last week. She was on a very high dose and was on this led for over a year. Not something you can just quit without talking to a doctor. When she was really down I sent her the numbers to some local crisis lines and she got mad at me saying she can’t afford to be hospitalized. I told her they are just numbers to talk and are free they can’t hospitalize you but she didn’t want to hear it. I don’t know what do. In the last bad period a few years ago where she almost attempted I was able to get her to go to therapy and it was really helping for a while.

I didn't express that very clearly in the last post, because I was pretty angry and wanted to get it out. Though, some concerned about if I was gonna kill myself. While I appreciate the concern, and I have had suicidal tendencies for a while now, I'm not gonna kill myself, not for a long time at least. That's because I like to create music and stories and shit, and at the risk of coming off as pompous, I'm an artist at my core. I have so many projects I want to finish and share, and I think every time someone creates a piece of art, metaphorically speaking, they put a little piece of their soul into making it. Soul as in, their energy, their experiences, their emotions, etc. I'm very lucky to sometimes have the energy to create art, and I have projects I want to finish, and if I'm dead, I'll never be able to finish those projects. The longer I live, the more experiences I'll have, including experience with anxiety and depression, the more my soul will grow, the more art I can create. The day I finish all of my projects and I have nothing else to give to the world, nothing I can create, I've created all I've could, that's the day I kill myself, because I've finished what I live to. But if I keep on willingly living, I'll never run out of stories to tell, I'll never run out of art to make. That's why I'm not gonna kill myself. So don't worry about me.

The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me . That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn. Edit Thanks for all the positive comments .I didn't the the post would get as much attention as it did with that being said I'm thankful , you guys were so nice and supportive in the comments . To those who have gone/ are doing through something similar or even worse , I sincerely hope you get better , you are loved and appreciated and from the bottom of my heart I'd like to say that you are cared for and I'm so sorry if anything makes you feel weak or not good enough . You are worth it and you are strong and if you feel you are being invalidated and ignored please talk to someone , there will always be someone who cares about you're mental health .",1,well_being_reddit_body
907,"2 years of going through 2 breakups and multiple diagnoses of different diseases at a very early age and never did I feel any sadness or cried. I knew I was depressed and avoiding it. And today suddenly while getting out of car I dropped my key and it fell into a pothole and I can’t stop crying since then. Life has been shit and I’m so tired. I haven’t even read a book in months. I can’t study, can’t read, can’t even play video games with concentration anymore. I’m so tired and yet I have so many responsibilities. Edit - Thank you to everyone who’s replying. I’m better now since the evening. I don’t know why but it was a sudden trigger. My car has been a way to just avoid any shitty situation. And losing the key was a very sudden trigger even though I knew I had another key. I get it’s a very weird thing to cry over but I just couldn’t stop. Thank you to all of you. The comments helped a lot. Edit 2- Thank you everyone! I’m fine now. I guess the trigger was suddenly too much to handle. I’m gonna try to get help here. I don’t think I’ll avoid it anymore.",1,well_being_reddit_body
908,"That’s pretty much it, honestly. I’m a person who gets bored so, so easily; of books, games, shows, physical hobbies, and even, or especially, people. Nearly everything I’ve had a consistent obsessive interest in has to do with psychology or neuroscience, all so I could find out *something* about myself. The Thing. Answers. Relief. But really, I’m just… normal, boring, with extremely unrealistic expectations. It’s like I’m a broken bucket, no matter what and how much I add to my life, I’d be left with nothing. Within hours. A few days if I’m lucky. Sure, I feel lonely, but I have damn good friends, we’re close, we connect so well. I have a great support system. Yet, I’m more likely to avoid all that. Because it’s not stimulating enough, or perhaps not stimulating in the right ways, nothing personal. What are the right ways? Absolutely no idea. At the end of that day, I find myself back to the void, whether I’m pulled back into it forcefully or… idk, I sought it out myself out of fear, seeking familiar comfort, doesn’t really matter. Oh I know, this will pass, something will spark my interest eventually, but I will come back to the emptiness after. It’s a cycle, clearly, and I’m simply so very tired of reliving it and being stuck.",1,well_being_reddit_body

Everybody deserves to live and be loved. Nobody deserves this. just turned 22, and here is how the days go. Wake up at some time after having taken Seroquel. Sluggish for an hour. Take Xanax. Stare at phone. Doze off. Think about killing yourself. Lay at a different side of your house. Watch YouTube or listen to music. Try to watch a movie or play a video game but you don't have the attention span. Think negative thoughts. Think about your failures. Eyes hurt. Think about killing yourself. Be ashamed of yourself. State at the wall. Idle on your phone. Take Xanax again. Take Seroquel. Sleep, repeat. Love it. Honestly, I just want to die at this point. Like there is no coming back, I'm done as a human being. My body and mind are broken. I'm non-functioning and the hospital didn't help. I can't focus on anything. I wish I could lose my life in my sleep and give it to someone who could use it for good. I'm incapable of even bathing myself and eating. I have the saddest life ever. I don't deserve this. I just wish my family were OK with it so that I could commit suicide.",1,well_being_reddit_body

912,"First time posting here, fairly new to reddit. I've been suffering from depression for years now and have been on many different kinds of medication. Things get bad occasionally and I have a bit of a spiral down. I guess I could feel it coming. I've had issues with work, losing my home (moved in with my bf though so that was a positive but not the way we wanted it because it was a fairly quick decision once I found out I couldn't keep my place anymore after the issues at work), money has been tight the last couple of years but in recent months money has been a massive issue for me, and I've been having some issues with family. I guess things have just been building up a lot. I was managing fine though, trying to keep things together until I made a post this morning on the relationships subreddit asking for advice about this situation with my mum and once comment from someone who had CLEARLY not even read my post was just so hurtful and horrid (even other people said it was unnecessary and they had clearly not even read my post) and it just kind of felt like my brain flipped a switch and I can feel myself just getting worse. I know it was my own fault for posting on reddit because what was I expecting to happen? And now I'm terrified of posting this or looking at my notifications for my other post.

I want people to leave me alone and deal with my problems instead of seeing me as a weak danger and bothering me about it. Or blaming themselves because apparently me hating life is their fault.

914,"Hi, I (m36) am currently in a long distance relationship. I love this woman but she has a severe drinking problem that she is trying to keep secret from me. The reason I know this is because her roommate has secretly been feeding me information about this. The fact that I know someone who I love is outright lying to me makes me extremely anxious. So much to the fact that I was forced to take medication to relieve my anxiety. My question is do I end the relationship with the woman I love to save my health. Ending the relationship require me I to throw the roommate under the bus because how else would she know I have this information. 3 lives would be effected if I did this.

916,"TL/DR at bottom. So, I know this isn't nearly as serious as some people on this sub reddit, and I don't want to detract from those that really need help, but I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this. I'm on vacation, first time in about a year that I have had several days designated to relax, but I feel like I have so much on my plate that I can't relax. Work has been extremely stressful, and I have been going the extra mile to make sure that things get done correctly there. I feel like I'm sorry far behind at work that I might pass myself trying to catch up. My wife an I have also trying to get the house ready for the largest family gathering we have ever had at our house. Finishing up a complete remodel and there are a bunch of little things that need to be done so that I feel people aren't judging me. With all that being said, now that I'm here it feels more stressful to try to force myself to relax than it would be to just keep working and try to get caught up. If I had the option of an invisibility cloak, I would take off of work, then go in so I can get caught up without anyone bothering me and pulling me away from the task at hand. I don't know if these feelings are genetic or learned, but I have heard my dad say essentially the same thing in past. I am on meds for anxiety. Has anyone else ever experienced this?

I'm not sure if I'm suffering from stress or if I have a condition. randomly throughout the day I get chest aches, arm aches, leg aches, and sometimes headaches. I will sometimes feel a little fatigue and dizziness. I overthink scary stuff like if I'm going to die because all these symptoms make me feel like I'm having heart problems or something serious, I get nervous and sweaty when I think about it. when I feel the left side of my chest (nipple area) it's really sore and painful, same with my left side. sometimes my heart will randomly hurt or at least I think it's my heart.
