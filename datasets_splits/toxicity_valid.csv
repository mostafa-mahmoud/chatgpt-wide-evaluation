The Assyrian tribes template could simply be made dormant (de-linked from articles with a note saying why that's been done) until you feel that you can include more complete articles on the tribes. The Nochiya Tribe article looks good. Being a syriacist, the only thing I noticed was that, in the ethnic groups template, the header says Nochiyayeh, but the script underneath says Nochiya — you need an extra yud zlami-pshuqi before the final alap. I agree with you that it would be good to have an article about the geographic homeland of Assyrians. However, it would be have to be carefully and named. You are right in suggesting the article Kurdistan as a good model, as it has avoided all sorts of attacks by those who suggest that it infringes the sovereignty of other nations. Also, even though modern Assyrians celebrate descent from the ancient Assyrians, we need to keep the articles seperate, as they are talking about two very different historical periods. Perhaps it would be good to have an article an article on Assyrian homeland that could be linked from the Assyria article in a dablink. —",toxicity

Hi, MurderWatcher1. This is Paul1513 again. This is to let you know that I have completed the SLR Chronology bibliography for you and that I am going to try to upload  a PDF copy to your Talk page as soon as I finish this note. This may take a while, because I've never uploaded a PDF before.

You're absolutely right; it would be great if some of the old Modern Photography stuff could be added to Wikipedia. However, you can be sure that they're still under copyright. (Pre-1978 American """"work-for-hire"""" copyrights are generally 75 years; 1978 and on, 95 years.) The real question is: Who OWNS the copyright today? Since Modern went under, there have been many media company sales and resales - the present copyright holder would be hell to uncover and ask permission. In fact, the current owner might not even know that it owns Modern's copyrights. """"Orphaned"""" copyrights are a major unresolved """"fair use"""" issue in the information age.

Speaking of first cameras: mine was a simple Vivitar 110 point-and-shoot. My parents gave it to me for getting straight A's  in the 5th grade. It was, of course, a bad camera, but it opened up a world of possibilities. From the Vivitar, I eventually learned about the existence of the Pentax Auto 110 SLR. It was then one step to 35 mm SLRs and I got a Nikon FE2 in 1983. The FE2 is also the reason why the bulk of my Modern Photography magazine citations begin around 1983.

I'm sorry to hear about your disputes with the Admins over your non-photography Wkipedia entries. It would be unfortunate if you felt compelled to end your Wikipedia activities over them. Perhaps you could start a blog or create a MySpace or Facebook page to air these issues without worrying about what the Admins want. However, I will respect whatever your decision is, as I fully understand that the most sophisticated machine is nothing next to a human life.

As the hills erode due to weathering and water flow the sediment from the hills is transported to the lower plain. Various creeks will carry the water further to a river, lake, bay, or ocean. As the sediments are deposited during flood conditions in the floodplain of a creek, the elevation of the floodplain will be raised. As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will over time seek new, lower paths, forming meanders (a curving sinuous path). The leftover higher locations, typically natural levees at the margins of the flood channel, will themselves be eroded by lateral stream erosion and from local rainfall and possibly wind transport if the climate is arid and does not support soil-holding grasses.

 Withdrawn charges 

The London Free press also reported that his charges were withdrawn silently. Now from the perspective of a normal criminal process, this usually means the police had a weak case. The fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all (judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case). In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.

What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.

To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in """"enforcing"""" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your """"administrative"""" tasks. That would be classified as Administrator Abuse Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_abuse. Furthermore, the fact that the IP address 72.136.34.96 spontaneously lost the ability to make edits without logging in with no explanation could also show a certain level of abuse of administrative rights (by the way. Will be reporting that to Jimbo Wales). So feel free to revert the edit I've made, but make an attempt to justify your actions this time.""",toxicity

Not sure where to put this, so I'll put it here. Tomorrow I'll take a peek at places like the Village Pump, the Help Desk, or perhaps the editorial council page thingy that I saw somewhere and see if I should post my query there.

I've noticed that a subject I've done some contributing to is lacking its own article. Cable television red-links to digital telephone service. General Communications, Inc. red-links to digital cable telephony (I created that one).

If I were king of the world, I would create an article called digital telephony and make both of the above-mentioned red-links redirects to it. Or perhaps I would create a disambiguation page that links to digital cable telephony, digital fiber-optic telephony, VoIP and other similar articles (some of which don't exist yet.

Alas, I might be king of the world — or at least have editing power in the Wikipedia — but I don't have the time or knowledge to create an entire article about it. What should be done? Should I (or someone else) create a stub and redirect both?

I'm just afraid that someone will create an article under one entry but it won't be tied together with another entry, and there will forever be a dichotomy...or at worst parallel universes in which information is not shared between related subjects.

Are my fears unfounded? Should I just leave it be and let it evolve on its own?

Um well, absence of research isn't research evidence of absence. There's no severely affected patients in that lot and they were only exercised modestly with regard to their illness status; the more sufferers push themselves the more aggravated symptoms and weakness should be. The sort of people who apply for exercise testing are not likely to be already on the verge of a relapse or struggling to cope at work (or even at home). If some of them have practical help or accomodating family they would do worse in the same tests without it. Gosh, no mention of exertional insomnia even.

Most of these studies aren't looking into a variety of somatic symptoms or even pain, only fatigue and functional strength (though the latter's good enough a demonstration of worsening after exercise for me. At the end of the day it's objective measures are most helpful).  If good evidence is totally lacking you have to use next best evidence, with caveats. 

You miss out a major notable source of good evidence in all the ME studies (and synonymous diagnoses) before c. 1988 or the 80's, for instance papers by Acheson, Gilliam, Galpine, Innes, Compston, Wallis et al.  This is after all, where exercise intolerance and severe multi-system symptoms were first described and recognised as a cardinal feature in non-remitting cases.  

There should also be some orthostasis studies. There's also Peckerman's heart studies, Les Simpson's trigger finger study, the Da Costa study, and so on. Though they might not be focussing on symptoms the sort and extent of findings likely gives indirect suppport to the extend and breadth of symptoms.

I think Daqu is exactly right - and if not, could somebody please explain why not?

That is, why not say:
""""An involution is an element of order 2.  A Coxeter group is any group generated by finitely many involutions.""""??

If true, that lets somebody know exactly what a Coxeter group is without knowing what the word """"presentation"""" means, or (worse) having to know or accept on faith any theorems about presentations.

Then the stuff about m_ij and so on could be presented as consequences of the definition.  And those who know about presentations could then say """"Ah, yes, and in fact the class of Coxeter groups can be defined via presentations"""".

I think in general definitions should involve just as little apparatus as possible, and only involve extra machinery when that significantly shortens and simplifies what is being defined.

An easier definition should never depend on a harder definition.

Of course, if i'm wrong and this is not what a Coxeter group is, somebody please explain and give a counterexample, and thanks in advance.

No, the planning took place in response to the Winter War. The British government may have been half hearted as Nick-D says, but certainly not the French nor the British public and press. From the Doerr paper Paul cites:
""""The reaction of the British public and press to the Soviet invasion of Finland was overwhelmingly hostile. Sympathy for Finland was strong. The Finns were seen as a small, embattled liberal state defying a totalitarian power. As the Finns battled against increasingly long odds, pressure grew on the British government to do something. Military supplies were sent to Finland along with some British volunteers. By March 1940 public pressure and pressure from the French forced the British government to agree to a wild plan to send British troops to Finland.""""

Again, NK never existed as a region before 1920s. While Nagorno translates as mountainous, it was never a separate region. And NK as a region is separated from Armenia by Kelbajar, Lachin and other districts of Azerbaijan. The sources above do not say that NK existed as a stand alone region historically. Even Russian imperial administrative divisions such as Jevanshir and Shusha uyezds included both mountainous and lowland parts of the region. So we need to clarify that NK as a region did not border Armenia. If we are talking about geographic region of Karabakh, then its mountainous part extends right to the border with Armenia, however upper and lower Karabakh historically formed a single region, and geographic concept of Karabakh includes both highlands and lowlands. The history of NK as a historical and political notion starts in 1920s, when it was artificially carved out of Karabakh to become an autonomy for Armenians. It was purely a Soviet invention. master """,toxicity

Response to help desk

Hi Rockingchick. Sorry your article was deleted, but it sounds like you were writing a biography of a non-notable person. We can't generally let people write articles about people they know or knew personally because it violates our policies of having everything verified by reliable sources (if you write about someone the wider world hasn't heard of we have no way of making sure what you wrote is true) and writing from a neutral point of view (you can't be neutral about someone you know personally). There are more specific guidelines as to who's considered notable at WP:BIO.

If you'd like some ideas for a good first article, you can try the Your first article (which is more a list of """"don't""""s) and the Requested articles pages. The community portal also has lots of other ways in which people can contribute to Wikipedia apart from writing new articles.

Hope this won't put you off editing Wikipedia, it can be quite hard to get stuck in at first, but don't worry - although sometimes it seems otherwise, people are always happy to put your mistakes right as long as you don't make a habit of repeating them.  (talk) """,toxicity

Speedy deletion of Adam Warin
 A tag has been placed on Adam Warin requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Below I am pasting an email from a historian, whom I asked about the correct title.| talk  

The truth is that the English language really has no equivalent to Freiherr (the title of the ruler) or Freiherrschaft (the title of the political entity), because neither or them existed in the English-speaking world.  The loose translations sometimes given (baron, barony) are inaccurate, in that they do not convey the concept of independent jurisdiction.  Medieval English barons were juridically much more subject to the kings than these (except for the few exceptions such as the liberty of the bishops of Durham and a few other historical exotica).
The concept wasn't limited to Silesia.  It existed throughout the Holy Roman Empire and within the hereditary domains of the Habsburgs, such as Bohemia after 1621.

1. Remove several events no longer organized by the World Sports Group: While they are not available as articles or news, the list of events can be found on the WSG website at http://www.worldsportgroup.com/assets/events/football/ and http://www.worldsportgroup.com/assets/events/golf/

2. Add information about how the matches are televised and fans should check their local TV listings.

- The match schedules are available at the AFC website at http://www.the-afc.com/en/fifa2014-schedule-a-results?id=116&type;=Stage

- In the USA, One World Sports will air all the matches. The match schedule can be found here: http://www.oneworldsports.com/scheduleday.php

The fact that I said something is VERIFIABLE, with ease.  Thus, it belongs on Wiki 'Jim Bell' page.  It would even be proper to place references onto 'Global Warming' and/or 'Greenhouse Effect', if prefaced with a statement that I, Jim Bell, claimed something.
    Moreover, I ALSO tried to edit to accuse the government of forgery.  On the Wiki page, 'Jim Bell', the issue is ALSO, """"Did Jim Bell accuse the government of forgery?"""".  The issue is NOT, """"Is what Bell alleged, TRUE?"""".  The fact that I ALLEGED that can be easily found on the Internet via Google:  """"Jim Bell 99-30210 forgery"""".  The fact that I alleged it can also be confirmed by calling me up on the telephone.  Thus, this allegation BELONGS on Wiki 'Jim Bell'.  Only an """"Info-Nazi"""" believes otherwise.

Now to answer your concern about vandalism reporting: vandalism is the kind of edit that no one should have a disagreement about.  Here are a couple of examples of true vandalism:   .  Edits other people want to make and you don't like are not vandalism, and it's a kind of incivility, if not a downright personal attack to describe someone's good faith edits as vandalism.

Please don't revert correct information as you did to Bath School disaster. The number in the article matches the reference cited plus the sentence says the number INCLUDES his wife. I put 44 to replace 43 because that is what that section represents. Also, if you notice in the info box of the list of deaths, it numbers 45 and that is not including the killer who commmited suicide. So 44 is accurate ONLY in the section cited. The number 43 is wrong any way you put it. I know it was the deadliest. How does me adding one person to the total in the section where it was incorrect (43) to my correction to 44 make it less deadlier? It makes it more accurate, right?

 Well, in a perfect world it would depend on the sourcing. As it stands? You could say it goes both ways.

I fear that certain editors here have not heeded the recent warnings whatsoever and are proceeding full steam ahead with attempting to make this Bible article a full fledged one-sided POV job, with insulting, inflammatory, and derogatory rhetoiric being directed at all those who take this story seriously.

We know there are anti-Christian and anti-Jewish bigots in the world: always have been, no doubt about that.  Why do we have to allow them to come here and spout their intolerance non-stop.

EDIT: The statement can be removed just on the basis that it adds no value to the article by making it even more biased towards enabling the Holocaust all over wikipedia. It assumes that - Leuchter doesn't know the amounts of cyanide needed to kill, and it assumes that Leuchter tried to disprove the gas chambers through ignoring the facts. Both of these without any proof that that's actually the case. 

Also, even if that was the case - what does """"tended to confirm it"""" mean? Even safe amounts of gas found by any interested parties would """"tend to confirm"""" that gassings took place, so it's irrelevant.

I have not placed any cites as I did not write the section originally. What I think we can do is, go from here, place in the relevent cite requests, and attempt to clean up this section. NOTES- (1)I left in the last sentence of the first paragraph. While it might be seen as """"original research"""" it is a fact, I'd prefer to let it go with a cite request to at least give someone else a chance to make it better. (2)I left in the last three paragraphs which you think don't deserve attention, however it is true, and this behavior definitely deserves attention in a """"comments and criticisms"""" section. I think the problem here is that it is not a clean section. The current wording certainly is of an axe grinding nature, but can be cleaned up and sourced to become good information. Here is the original section I've pulled from-
Personally, I prefer this info to be integrated into the article more seamlessly, but I have accepted """"comments/criticism"""" sections as a necessary part of these types of articles as there tends to be no other way to share this information without damaging the integrity of the article. Insertion of information regarding Hitler's abuse of drugs after his assasination attempt, or Exxon's treatment of the Valdez incident, and subsequent hand wringing over the suit, to all be examples of pertinent info regarding individuals and companies that can easily be perverted to a non-objective position, but are still highly valuable when done correctly.
So this done, let's all take it easy. Those who think it is a poor section please leave it and place in your cite requests. Those who think it deserves to stay can work to find those cites and clean it up. This can and will become a good section if we let it be and allow for the open source machine to work it's magic.

It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site.

The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity.

That is """"Charles Sturt's Pondebadgery"""".  I am not 100% sure it is an Indigneous word though I said the place was referred to by it.  That remains correct.  Multiple layer stuff.  I suspect that 'ponde' is cheyanne or sioux as talking to those people its their word, but Sturt may very well have made that name up and I suspect he did.  Some Sioux etc were very much in the Gundagai area but Sturt may have known the word before he went downriver.  It seems he left a ponde downriver also.  Another aussie word that is native american is 'creek'.  We do not blink at its use, ever. Sturt did record the pondebadgery word.  What pondebadgery refers to is appropriate and is in context and association, just the vowles etc do not sound to me that ponde is a Wiradjuri word.  NOTE:  I did not note that it was a wiradjuri word. I only note Wiradjuri words if they have a known ethnology.  Sturt records Warby being at Pondebadgery.  This is the g.g.granddad of Ben Warby who holds the world water speed record.  Warby does not record 'pondebadgery' nor does anyone else in all of Australia's story that I am aware of and I have looked extensively. Just Sturt does though badgery or budgeri is previously recorded.  """"Charles Sturt's Pondebadgery"""" is more correct than what it has been edited to as that edit seperates Sturt from the word when no one knows that at all so its factually incorrect and should not be done as its making something that was correct as it stood, into fiction.

I see all secular governments in this world as my enemies.Whether Atheistic Communism,such as is seen in China and North Korea,or Democracy.

As democracy becomes more and more secular,it becomes more and more my enemy.If democracy is to be truly secularized,then everything pertaining to God would need to be removed from it.I do not see the removal of God and the replacement of atheism as being an improvement
in my world. Democracy ultimately must be my enemy,it is to complex,and it has to much material power for it to be a true branch of Christ's Government.

I was shaped by Secular humanism at a very early age(10).I was not raised as a Christian.I accepted the theory of evolution in school,and became an atheist. This was a disaster for me,my life reached a dead end.I began searching for God,and found all of the answers to life's mysteries that were previously unanswered.

to do their dirty work for them,such as fight their material wars in

Because I naively expect people to be reasonable and put the best face on things?  Because I'm not perfect, and didn't think it would be an issue?  Because I'm trying to do things the way they ought to be done, rather than the idiotic way they are done?

Or how about that good old standby, because shit happens…

Don't blame me for the flaws in the system.  I presented a project-wide conceptual problem - I don't see it as a content problem because it spans multiple pages and stems from divergent understandings of policy, and I honestly didn't want to start up a whole new round of ridiculous interpersonal behavioral drama.  ArbCom had a choice: to cast this as an issue of foundation principles (which they could reasonably have involved themselves with) or to cast it as a content issue and dismiss it.  they decided to do the latter for reasons of their own.  C'est la vie.

it's not a huge issue; this will quickly end up on ArbCom's plate anyway as a matter editor behavior, from some place or other - there's just too much tension around this particular problem, and too many people acting out on it like children.  If arbcom needs the shit to hit the fan before they tell people to stop throwing shit, that's their business; I've decided I'm not going to be the one starting the shit-fight.  I gave them the opportunity to be proactive and responsible and they refused, so now we just have to sit tight and wait for the inevitable crap-fest so we can bring it up again.

Facts were established earlier, however, for J. Smith's 1827 return to California and the completion of the expedition at Fort Vancouver.

I found that J. Smith visited San Jose, Monterey and Yerba Buena, California before heading north up the Sacramento Valley. The Alson Smith book doesn't give the exact route of travel from San Jose to Monterey, but it seems unlikely that the expedition passed through my home turf in Santa Cruz County (my original question). They probably used the more established El Camino Real by way of Mission San Juan Bautista. 

Helped by the Alson Smith book (without citing it), I was able to expand several more articles, including:

Perhaps I seem to be repeating myself as you are repeatedly ignoring what I'm writing. The tables are unclear as the order of the product is unclear from them. E.g. the top-right corner of the first table is e6. But does that mean e1 × e7 = e6 or e7 × e1 = e6 ? It would not matter if the product is commutative but as it's not the tables are ambiguous. That is why tables are a very poor way to show the product, and probably why none of the sources use them.
And again please read MOS:LEAD in paticular the section on providing an accessible overview. Or look at the articles already mentioned, Special relativity and Cross product. Or one you are familiar with, Pythagorean theorem. Or a similarly advanced article to this one (and a featured article), Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector.

 African Americans are multiracials 
Countless studies and research have shown that African Americans aren't pure blacks, like you would find in Africa, but multiracials. They have Native American and Caucasoid in their ancestry, from being raped and what have you. Technically speaking, they are a completely separate race from """"Black people"""", as they aren't pure blacks. The only reason they're often categorized as such is because of the One-Drop rule. Shouldn't this fact be noted in the heading of the article. At least something about them being multiracials as opposed to pure blacks? 66.175.204.183    —Preceding unsigned comment added by 66.175.200.14   

That's because """"race"""" varies over a fairly smooth space of variable phenotypes and two races are described as different when there is a discontinuity.  That is to say, before civilized times, one was not really able to tell the difference between one's neighbors, and one was rather unlikely to encounter people who looked substantially different until more modern and effective means of transportation and higher population densities allowed for it.  Your views on racial mixing """"creating a new race"""" is bizarre, since it takes race to be an immutable and discrete classification system.  This is the same kind of fallacy that leads one to ask for the """"missing link"""" for evolution.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.7.82.22   

What do you mean by all that bombastic rigmarole?! I am stating a very simple truth, which is that African Americans are a mixed race because we have Caucasoid, Native American, and Negroid in us. People might wonder to themselves how can Tisha Campbell be black or Negroid when she doesn't look black by any stretch of the imagination. The answer is simple: because she's African American and skin colors range all across the board in the African American community. I have several people in my family who are the color of Tisha Campbell and that's because African Americans are NOT Negroids. We're multiracials. Research has been done proving this; not to mention, I have proof within my family tree. 66.175.201.77  """,toxicity

I think noone is saying with """"failed state"""", that there are no parts of the state where organization has resulted in quite a livable situation. But that seems to be not due to, but sometimes (in the case of Somaliland) despite the fact that there is no permanent central government who has an ligitimate monopoly on power. The fact that there are promising things happening in Somalia outside the central government is a good thing, but that only stresses that the state as such at this moment can be characterized a failed state. If definitions for Somalia have been used differently, please provide a source...

The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers (not really a grand final, as it was still part of the regular fixtures), which resulted in a draw, 4.10 (WP) to 4.7 (R) – I'm guessing behinds weren't counted at this stage. Also, I think this comment pretty much confirms it: """"Fremantle supporters will feel very sore at not having any interest in the final match for the premiership. Really they have themselves to blame for the school-boyish behavior they have shown in ignoring the Association."""" Fremantle later challenged Rovers to a premiership decider under any umpire selected except Mr. Croft, which Rovers quite rightfully declined to take part in.

As one person notes on the history page, even through I am the author for several of the seminal works (no other person on the planet has written all the main english language handbooks, or the seminal articles in the mainstream published literature, or the two seminal works in TIME and Forbes web pages), this is solid constructivce information that should not be dismissed.

I ask that the person continually undoing my modest constructive work be himself blocked, and that my specific contributions be locked in so as to end this foolishness.  I spent five days developing this page a few years ago, and my work was destroyed by vandals from CIA, from one especially stupid journalist pretender, and from Wiki trolls who delight in deleting and do not have a clue about the actual subject matter.

The editing wars on this page, and the obvious bias inserted by CIA people who are in denial are what is responsible for the complete lack of interest in this page.  There are no fewer than NINETY government open source units around the world, and not a single one of them has bothered to enter information here because this page is regarded as being under the control of idiot Americans who are self-centered and care nothing about the real world.

So you all have a choice: we can make this page real, and internation, or you can let it revert to irrelevant, incomplete, and largely incorrect.

Not after the response, I guess, but would it be admissible all the way to the top, right after the words of Sanguinetti? Or somewhere in the middle?

Wikipedia takes copyright violations very seriously;  and does not accept material copied from other sources unless it is in the public domain, or released to us under a free license   (It is, by the way, not necessary for pages to have a notice to be copyright:  everything published on the internet or elsewhere is copyright to the owner of that content unless specified otherwise.) 

It might be possible to get permission, but there is no point in doing soa web site of this sort almost always is unsuitable for WP, because it is usually written as a press release, praising rather than describing the subject and containing material we would not include.  It is therefore always better to rewrite. 

Please never copy this way from an outside source again, and be absolutely certain that in everything you have previously written, there is not just no copying , but no Close paraphrase. If there is, rewrite that part from scratch, changing not just the words, but the arrangement into sentences and the sequence of ideas.  '''''' ( talk )",toxicity

Victoria seems to have signalled she was doing a tight turn without engines (there were signaling devices to indicate if engines were reversed). Markham seems to have started off  with a textbook standard turn and then panicked too late, trying to turn faster. I thinkat the time the suggestion that the lines might have crossed was dismissed, but then, would a court-martial made up of the people involved have come to the conclusion that there was a simple workable solution which would have avoided the sinking.

Hello Again. I don't have the ability to counter AlmostGrad's assertions on the SE talk page today. But I want to make sure you understand that AlmostGrad is a COI editor. On AlmostGrad's user page: """"I have a Conflict of Interest with Suburban Express stemming from my interactions with them on the UIUC subreddit."""" So she has established a link to Reddit. On Reddit, AlmostGrad100 has tirelessly posted unsubstantiated claims about Suburban Express. AlmostGrad100 seems to have catalyzed the very negative blog coverage that AlmostGrad repeatedly cites on Wikipedia talk page. As for AlmostGrad's recent addition to the talk page: I consider all false statements to be problematic, including the trivial examples which are cited in the most recent addition. The existence of trivial errors does not preclude there from being more significant errors, and there are. And I intend to enumerate those ASAP. WRT Streisand Effect, attempts by AlmostGrad to add Sub Ex to the Streisand Effect article have been rejected. Thank you for your time.   """,toxicity

There seems to be a bizarre NPOV inconsistency being raised over articles relating to people killed in Ireland.

There is a vocal and persistent lobby which is pro Irish Republican, many of whom belong to Wikipedia:WikiProject_Irish_Republicanism, which argues (I think) that a death is a killing until somebody is found guilty of murder even when that killing is generally defined and established as murder by law and in the international press.""""...(kiwiexile at DMOZ)  • """,toxicity

If you were to include this incident the next time something happens they will point to this incident as the reason why the new incident should be included even if minor (example: criticism section) Personally I don't even think that Ryanair flight 296 should be included and it definitely should not have it's own article. For one, there was no fire (which it says in the main article and flight 296 article) only smoke from the release of oil from the broken bearing. Secondly it was the passengers who opened and tried to exit on the wrong side (not sure how that is Ryanair's fault that passengers would exit towards the firefighters) Thirdly, the only problem for Ryanair is that some of the staff had trouble opening the doors but still everybody was able to evacuate in 90 seconds. Then in the flight 296 wiki article they even talk about how paying for uniforms and training in eastern Europe had something to do with the incident even though no ref is provided.

MESSAGE FROM YOGIRAJ GURUNATH AND HAMSA YOGA SANGH

Dan, thank you for sharing the message from Yogiraj Gurunath Siddanath. I was impressed with the message and the tone of it. Wikipedia articles, unfortunately, are not the places to convey one's spiritual state. And the NPOV policy attracts, and even requires, naysayers and doubters. I've seen this in articles of great souls that I KNOW have deep realization. Fortunately, there are better places for sharing realization and spiritual teachings. May you quickly reach self-realization, and my apologies for some unkind things that I said in all this. As your Guru said, """"Let us meditate more and talk less!""""  """,toxicity

Dear Woohookitty,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

Well, thank you so much for your reply. I hoped you would! About six months ago I noticed how badly ballroom dancing in general was being treated on WP, and decided to do something about it. I had been taught dancing by someone who had taken tuition in the latin dances from Pierre & Lavelle, so I knew their names from being a teenager in the 1950s. I wish now I had taken the trouble to meet them, but I didn't. Since I'm something of an expert on Cuban music I decided to start with the group of dancers who started LA dancing in England, from where it has spread all over the world. 

I soon discovered the lack of reliable reference sources was the main problem. I kept seeing references to Pierre, but it was ages before I had enough to put up the page on WP. I still don't have enough for Lavelle. With difficult cases I start a Word file offline. Anything on WP gets copied by bots and plagiarised widely. Even these personal pages.

I've got copies of all the books written about LA dances at that time, including both Dimitri's books and Pierre's book. I don't know where you are, of course, but if you are somewhere in England, we might arrange to meet, and you could have a look at the books. It sounds as though you don't have a copy of his first book.

I've tried to interview all the survivors from that time. So far, I've only found two. I'd certainly like to meet your father if he was willing. He's bound to have lots of things tucked away at the back of his mind which might help us. And I'll answer more fully about myself, but not on WP (for reason given above)

Now I'm going to let you have my e-mail address. If you wish, you could send me an e-mail, which would automatically give me yours. Then, once you know your e-mail has worked, please wipe off my e-address from this page after you've stored it, preferably on a private machine rather than one available for general use (open machines without good security get scanned regularly).

Hi again, and well done for registering. 

Regarding the link that you were/are wanting to add to the Correlation and dependence article, I suggest the following... (i) you could best make your points for inclusion on the article's talk/discussion page, so that others can comment ... the edit summary and user's talk pages are not good for this; (ii) you could try to find a place in the article to make some kind of helpful reference to this link's content (that is, an inline citation rather than it just appearing in a bald way under """"External links""""), so that readers would know that the link is meant to be useful regarding """"interpretation""""; (iii) if you feel that this link does have something particularly useful to say, or a good way of looking at things, then you could try to summarise/ re-state these points within the article itself  ...again you could ask for opinions/help on the article's talk page, but there is really no reason why you shouldn't go ahead and add something. My own opinion is that adding plain """"external links"""" should be avoided once an article has substantial content. A previous editor mentioned """"linkspam"""" and, while this link might not quite fit within that term, the website itself didn't seem to have a lot of other content (but I could be wrong) and the """"substantiality"""" of the source has some bearing on whether a link is appropriate.

If you have an inclination to help in improving the content of the statistics articles more generally you should see Wikipedia:WikiProject Statistics. There is certainly need for help in improving the """"understandability"""" of all of the statistics articles, so don't be put off if there seems to be an emphasis on mathematical technicalities.

Hate speech is serious, Mr Malber.  As I recall, your involvement with Wikipedia Review was because you were guilty of hate speech, in that you suggested that """"people with autism should not be allowed to edit Wikipedia"""".  Malber, you are a poor person to comment on such an issue.  You should have been banned from Wikipedia for your comments, yet here you remain, continuing with your hate speech.  You are quite correct that Amorrow engaged in hate speech, although of a lesser variety of the kind used by you.  He was banned, as you were.  You, Malber, were banned for hate speech.  Did you forget this?  Perhaps you forgot this.  The place that is the only place devoted to criticism of Wikipedia is indeed important.  You can disagree with as much of it as you like.  Criticism, by its very nature, is not generally accepted by those who it is critical of.  This does not illegitimise it.  There are many and varied very legitimate criticism.  One such criticism is why a hate-monger such as yourself is not banned from Wikipedia.  Perhaps you are biased in this however.  Perhaps you'd like to argue how you are less of a hate speaker than anyone who has ever posted on Wikipedia Review.  As far as our evidence has proven, you are much worse than the worst on WR.

This is NOT the correct definition of queer.  According to the free dictionary dot com, queer is """"Deviating from the expected or normal; strange: a queer situation. 2. Odd or unconventional, as in behavior; eccentric. See Synonyms at strange.""""  And according to Merriam-Webster, queer means """"a  differing in some odd way from what is usual or normal. b (1)  eccentric, unconventional (2)  mildly insane  touched.""""  And according to common sense, queer is not exclusive to """"sexual and gender minorities that are not heterosexual, heteronormative, or gender-binary

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

 If some metals form an alloy this alloy has specifics of its own, not a combination of the different metals it is made up of. I'm pretty sure the following declaration is nonsense from a sientific point of view (emphasis mine): The overtones are a result of using an alloy consisting of multiple metals, each producing its own overtone. New bowls can also produce multiple harmonic overtones if they are high quality bronze, but many are made from a simpler alloy and produce only a principal tone and one harmonic overtone. I have heard a cast iron bowl with a very impressive rich tone - and that is a very simple alloy...
 Additionally the term """"aging process"""" in the following paragraph and the last sentence of the section """"Antique singing bowls"""" needs a sientific explanation: The aging process greatly improves the tone and centuries old antiques produce an incredibly rich and beautiful sound. I'm pretty sure the beautifully sounding antique singing bowls were sounding equally rich at their producing time. You don't find lousy antique bowls today because as soon as their metal worth exceeded their beauty or practical worth as a container at any time in the past they were molten down.

Hello, Xeltifon. Someone963852 is simply going by our rules on this. There won't be enough work that you can do to make it acceptable to mention in the lead that zoophilia is a sexual orientation. It has been made extensively clear on this talk page and elsewhere that it is a fringe assertion to call it a sexual orientation, per WP:FRINGE. The Wikipedia:Fringe theories/Noticeboard would also make this clear if this matter were taken there. Zoophilia either shouldn't be called a sexual orientation in this article at all or can only be called one with WP:DUE WEIGHT; it is already mentioned with due weight lower in this article. You saw where it is mentioned lower, as you added it in. However, such a sexual orientation mention was included lower in the article before at some point (different points in time).
 
And with regard to what you stated in this edit summary about the lead, that is not exactly what WP:LEAD says. Citations may or may not be allowed in the lead, but are usually advised to be in the lead for controversial topics. Zoophilia is clearly a controversial topic.

And regarding bolding the terms, alternative terms should be bolded in the lead. Sometimes, they are also bolded lower in the article at first mention. See WP:BOLDTITLE. I would object to your removal of the alternative terms from the lead, per WP:Alternative titles, but, also per WP:Alternative titles, """"If there are at least three alternative names, or there is something notable about the names themselves, a separate name section is recommended."""" And, as you know, there is a section in this article to discuss these terms. Still, it is sometimes best to mention the alternative titles in the lead as well, especially if one or more of them is very well known as an alternative title.

1) When there is no further reading section, should I A) create one or B) add the information in the reference section (I feel that may be a faux pas)or C) do something else like ... run Forrest run? 
 
2) Unfortunately I have not had anyone write a bio for me... yet. I'm afraid I am responding at a poor time because while I usually dominate Google searches with my books, interviews, and my Blog at Sulekha, at the moment I am a distant second on the first page. Sadly, I share the name of Charles Spencer King with the inventor of the Range Rover.... This confuses many a seeker as you might imagine. Regrettably, Mr. King (the other) died in the last month, and that has thrown the proverbial monkey wrench into the rankings (Addendum: I assure you I am alive and well).

    I would love to at the very least get into the Disambiguation section, however I am afraid I would need a bio for that.... Am I correct?

Hey Koreans, who the fuck do you think you're dealing with. Guess what, Gaogouli was a Chinese vassal you stupid fucks. After the fall of the Tang Dynasty, close to 700,000 were incorporated into Tang history, a little less than half migrated to the Central Plains, 100,000 to the Chinese state of Bohai and only 100,000 into Xinluo (Silla). Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese.

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself, Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield, despite being a significantly smaller force. If anything, Gaogouli only DEFENDED itself from assaults from Sui and Tang. Gaogouli was a mere Chinese vassal, nothing more. The greatest threat came from the TuBo, TuJue and HuiHe from the west. Koreans are a bunch of fucking attention whores.

Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!!

Likewise, Catt's """"electromagnetism"""" does not pass muster. """"Displacement Current (and how to get rid of it)"""" throws up quite enough problems. Reading it critically reveals that although the article makes assertions about displacement current, the only """"real science"""" is does is to model the voltage at the source end of a transmission line as it is charged through a resistor. Since """"displacement current"""" is the prediction that a changing electric field causes a magnetic field, the only way to disprove the concept is to disprove the existence of the effect. Catt et al didn't even try to do this. It would appear that they think that because they can get to the end of the calculation without introducing """"displacement current"""" that they can say that it doesn't exist. They are in total denial of the fact that their mathematics works because it has the equations that describe a capacitor built into it. Catt has quoted Davidson as (in effect) calling the Telegrapher's Equations """"absurd"""" because they model a TL as a capacitor, when Catt & Davidson know that a capacitor is a TL. [Electromagnetics ch6]. Although Catt would undoubtedly claim that the equations describing the TL are based on experiment they are, in fact, derived from the Telegrapher's Equations in the first place.

That helped a lot, thanks. The thing is most of the media sources in India(often considered the criteria for WP:RS) neither present an event in its complete terms nor is there a neutral perspective ever if any. A lot of issues and persons have been badly attacked by almost every section of the mainstream media, and it is so extremely rare to hit upon a site that gives some fair perspective or the other side of the coin but then they are not generally regarded in front of what the usual sources like The Hindu or the TOI which omits to cover certain parts of India and most of what is published is highly opinionated. The other day, content based on a fairly reasonable source was removed and this was hugely absurd since none of other mainstream media even covered the 2011 Tamil Nadu elections at a length, except for announcing the winning coalition.  Nothing much(in fact nothing at all) is mentioned of this person and his campaigning that brought about the fall of the ruling alliance. At the moment, various Youtube channels and small-scale news agencies(that probably don't even own a website of their own) are the only bearers of pieces of information and its bloody unbelievable that I'am the first wikipedian trying to get all these into Wikipedia. Excluding this personality, There are several others more who are making significant popular impact, but are nowhere to be found in Wikipedia. Its more pitiful that the already experienced and active Indian Wikipedians are not giving a damn either. It only brings editors like me to the suspicion that the existing chaps are perhaps too opinionated and biased to ignore true and essential information coming out, and worse still they are the first to sponsor/support opposition towards others who try to step in for the sake by bringing WP:RS every time. Thousands of other articles meanwhile, present heck loads of falsehood and bulls*it. I'am not using that as an excuse, but you know, its just surprising(and suspicious) the extent of controversy that is inflicted on a select few articles.

Potential and kinetic are a very general classification of energy forms. As stated in the present version of the article, these are mostly useful in mechanics. Based on the fact that a photon has no mass, the equations that are given in the present definition of kinetic energy are not applicable to electromagnetic radiation. I must say I agree with Andries. Also, this article is part of an encyclopedia. Why should it be limited  to the basic definitions of kinetic and potential energy forms and I see no reason why we are trying to associate energy forms as to being only potential or kinetic. I like the work done by Bensaccount, but I think it needs to be elaborated. Electrical energy, for example, has both forms of potential and kinetic energies. According to """"Principles of science"""", 1966, the most common forms of energy are mechanical energy, chemical energy, heat energy, sound energy (compressional waves), light energy (electromagnetic radiation), electrical energy and nuclear energy. I think if someone would like to expand on these it would be benificial to everyone.

Since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish, and then build to the rematch at Superbrawl the next month. So benoit """"won"""" the match(with Sid's leg clearly on the ropes), and then the next night on Nitro the decision was overturned. The official result of the Sould Out 2000 Main Event was """"Chris Benoit and Sid Vicious fought to a no-contest"""". End of story. Except not. Pissed off at the shitty booking, Benoit confronted booker Kevin Sullivan(who benoit had a personal history with re: Nancy). Sullivan then told Benoit if he didn't like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked. benoit took him up on it and jumped to the WWF. The difference between this and the millions of other screwjob/Dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next, then being handed back....the bgelt was vacant before Benoit """"won"""" the title, thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more. Sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his """"pinning the wrong Harris"""". Officially at the time the belt went from Hart to a vacant state to Kevin Nash awarding the belt to himself........

Okay, so Vinnie Mac has bought at WCW and recognised both Benoit's and Sid's first wins as World Title Wins. He has also recognised Hulk Hogan's two AWA Dusty Finishes as official World Title Wins. I don't like it, but I guess it's official now. The obvious question is, since Vince owns WWE, WCW, ECW and AWA can he, say overturn David Arquette's WCW World Title win at this point? That's just stupid.

Sabine, I very much disagree with your view of economics.

At the top I just expressed myself in a fun sort of way.

John Quiggin feels he has the right to censor my funny way of saying I totally disagree with you. 

He just deleted the top part. 

I think that is wrong. 

Just as you have all the right in the world to state your view, so I have all the right in the world to say I totally disagree with you. Even in a fun way - if I so feel like it and not insult you. Lunatic fringe - in my view - is applied to everybody to everyone else who they do not agree with. 

I hope you see it that way too.

I also have the right to excercise my author´s liberty and say it in a non-conventional way.

Okay, I used to be a troll and a vandal.  I used to be large amounts of my time insulting and upsetting users and ruining articles for my own amusement. Recently, I decided to turn a new leaf and become a decent, respectful contributor. I created an article called Adult Diapers in France. In this article, I included references and I hoped to create a series based on adult diaper production by country.

Within minutes , User:Escape Orbit slapped a speedy deletion notice onto my article, without even suggesting how to improve my article and claimed that I was 'advertising' and my page was 'unambiguously promotional'. This user did not even try to rewrite or improve this article.

Secondly, User:Purplewowies claimed that I should have taken the advice of this helpdesk first, then create my article. However this was not possible as I had already created my article BEFORE the helpdesk replied. Maybe the helpdesk should be more quicker.

In conclusion, I am getting fed up of wikipedia. I am getting fed up of how admins just pounce on you if you are a newbie. I am seriously thinking of trolling and vandalising again. Good day",toxicity

Hurmata objects to QuizzicalBee's sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed Chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from Chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited. QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid.

Greetings Bloodofox, just wanted to stop in and say thanks for all the hard work you're doing to make sure the Troll article is as accurate as it can be. I can tell that you have a passion for both wikipedia and Norse mythology.

I was wondering though, is there anyway that we can work together to help bring people up to speed on the issues of Trolls in terms of the RfC responders? Your recent comments make it appear that you're tired of having to answer the same questions again and again, which I can relate to. And I understand that you have better things to do with your time then to spend all day explaining things to everyone, though IMHO, it's just not going to help anything to bite the people who come in to respond to the RfC, or just to help in general. They are coming in under good faith, trying to help, however misguided that help may be. 

IMHO, we could gain more protectors and contributors to the article and any future content issues, by welcoming them and helping to bring them up to speed on the current issues. At the moment, I haven't found any qualifications to answering RfC's, and officially, wikipedia doesn't require anyone to know the rules to edit. So there are probably going to be more people coming in with similar suggestions, who have little or no knowledge of Norse mythology or the origins of Trolls. I know it's tiring, but it's also not going to be the end of the world if we take the time to educate new editors in a tactful manner. In any case, you've been around wikipedia a lot longer than I have, and I'm sure your patience is beyond tried. I'm just trying to help you avoid a wikiquette dispute or anything beyond that.

Yes, a common age for young officers to enter the Navy was about 12 or 13 as """"volunteers"""" or """"captain's servants"""" followed by promotion to midshipman by 13 or 14, see Nelson for example. Some successful officers joined when older but that meant 17 or so, see Cochrane.

Thanks Random. I agree that that is a better approach, because it lets us de-couple the link text from the link. But in this case I think the redirects are legitimate, and it is good to point into the list via them as they insulate the template against any change in target. i.e. if someone creates an article on an R-phrase, the redirect can be re-targetted. If we were linking directly into the list, we'd be stuffed.
Bryan, if you prefer the tooltip to say """"Explosive when dry"""" rather than """"R1: Explosive when dry"""", you could change  from

""""Do you have any sources to suggest what these Buddhist actually call themselves? They call themselves Dalits for all I know"""".
I have the vociferous complaints of the editors on this very talk page who self-identify as Buddhist, for one.  Please read the entire talk page, I'll be happy to provide as many diffs as you like if you choose not to. For more sources, there are several websites devoted to this.  While they can't be used in the article, they certainly can be used to clear up this point.
 """"Moreover I know my Wiki conventions far better than you. It is also not Wikipedia's mission to serve as a PR source""""
What I do and do not know is arguable, and remains to be seen. I'm certainly not advocating that Wikipedia or this article become a PR source, either for the movement itself or for those who oppose them.""""Firstly, Buddhism never died in India"""".
I quite agree with you, if the internet is any indication. I've found 45 different Buddhist groups of varying strength in a directory aimed at listing Buddhist groups throughout the world (on a side note, I plan to contact as many of these groups as I can, for a seperate matter). That was just a cursory bit of research, and not aimed at that particular assertion.  I'm sure more energtic research will reveal more.

New Pages update
Hey  ). A quick update on how things are going with the New Page Triage/New Pages Feed project. As the enwiki page notes, the project is divided into two chunks: the """"list view"""" (essentially an updated version of Special:NewPages) and the """"article view"""", a view you'll be presented with when you open up individual articles that contains a toolbar with lots of options to interact with the page - patrolling it, adding maintenance tags, nominating it for deletion, so on.

On the list view front, we're pretty much done! We tried deploying it to enwiki, in line with our Engagement Strategy on Wednesday, but ran into bugs and had to reschedule - the same happened on Thursday (. We've queued a new deployment for Monday PST, and hopefully that one will go better. If it does, the software will be ready to play around with and test by the following week! ).

On the article view front, the developers are doing some fantastic work designing the toolbar, which we're calling the """"curation bar""""; you can see a mockup here. A stripped-down version of this should be ready to deploy fairly soon after the list view is; I'm afraid I don't have precise dates yet. When I have more info, or can unleash everyone to test the list view, I'll let you know ). As always, any questions to the talkpage for the project or mine. Thanks!   """,toxicity

  Venue suggestion needed for a meet-up in Yuen Long


Dear:  ： 

In the past meet-ups, we always had our meeting in the centre of Kowloon, either Kowloon Tong or Mong Kok. However, apart from these places, I am sure that alternative venues in other region would be suitable.

This is the time for your suggestion! According to some discussion on Chinese Wikipedia, from August of 2007, the Hong Kong Wikimedians’ meet-up would be held in all districts of Hong Kong in a circulation basis.

Here is the tentative information of the first meet-up：
 Date：11, August, 2007 (Saturday) 
 Time：After 5:00pm
 Proposed region：Yuen Long

The community would request for ideas of where we should hold the meet-up , in order to have a better decision. If you have any good ideas, don’t hesitate to give your opinions, million thanks!

Regards,
Hong Kong Wikimedian

And that's where you get into the whole WP:Crystal argument, which I can't even get an acceptable answer with on the help desk.  I am not going to have someone else's reality enforced upon me, on Wikipedia or anyplace else.  If that's a problem, have me blocked or banned and do it quickly!  The character of Daniel Bryan, the moment he declared intention, put that match on the card.  If that intention (see Kennedy-Edge) changes, WE CAN REMOVE IT LATER!  The only reason the WWE announced Rock-Cena, and you still need to source """"out of story"""" announcement in that regard, is because the character of The Rock and the character of John Cena stated the very same level of intention to face each other at Wrestlemania.  Or is it the fact that you (collectively) believe Daniel Bryan is scum and that the position of The Rock and Cena as legends gives them the right to impose that reality that Bryan has not and will never have earned?  And, as for the Triple Threat option  very correct  same thing, WE CAN CHANGE IT LATER WHEN IT HAPPENS.  Another option already proposed is that the Royal Rumble winner would face the WHC, and THEN Bryan cashes in.  But what level of intention breaks WP:Crystal?

 Rindge article 

Hi DH,

Thanks for getting in touch about the population figure in the Rindge, New Hampshire article.  I did hesitate about restoring the info, because every edit you've done has been thoughtful and informative.  As I alluded to in the edit history, basically if you see a town in New Hampshire with a 2005 population estimate figure, it's because somebody first put in a figure and called it """"2005 Census"""".  Since there is no such thing, I consult the state Office of Energy and Planning web page, which conducts yearly population estimates, and retrieve the published figure for that town. (Concord and Peterborough are a few other places where I've had to do that.)  I can see the point of wanting to stick with just the decennial census figures, but I also see that there is a lot of pressure out there among readers to come up with more recent population figures  it may be boosterism, but it also may be caused by people concerned at how rapidly their community is growing.  Anyway, I've enjoyed watching your edits go in, and I look forward to seeing more!   """,toxicity

Just my 2 cents:
 When I say """"I weigh 87 kg"""" I am abusing the word """"weight"""" to mean that my mass is 87 kg. I'm not abusing the word """"kilogram"""" to mean that the Earth pulls me down with 0.85 kN. I am not willing to look at each revision of that intro paragraph (with my 56K connection it'd take me more time than it'd be worth), but the revision of 27 October (""""In everyday usage, the mass of an object in kilograms is often referred to as its weight, although strictly speaking the weight of an object is the gravitational force on it, measured in newtons (see also kilogram-force)."""") seems quite correct to me. 
 Most of the section """"Mass versus weight"""" doesn't belong to an article about an unit of measurement. If it did, it would belong to the article about the pound, and so on. The mention of the kilogram-force is relevant, but I'd prefer all the rest to go to the Weight article, if anywhere.  """,toxicity

 I disagree that """"[you] set our own social norms by concensus [sic]"""".  ([you], meaning the community, not Heironymous).  I agree that there appears to be such a rule, or your claimed practice, but in my experience 'consensus' is honored far more in the breach than the actual observance.  Indeed, one of my repeated criticisms against Dodo was the fact that he certainly didn't wait for any sort of 'consensus' to develop, and in fact he directly prevented such a consensus simply by reverting in minutes or hours, rather than allowing that consensus to develop.  I think, instead, the 'consensus' claim is primarily used in order to attack, rather then to defend.  In one posting, for example, Dodo actually claimed that I hadn't obtained a 'consensus' that would allow me to make an edit!  (I have never seen any other person make such a weird claim, but on the other hand I haven't seen anybody criticize Dodo for that obvious gaffe.)  I viewed that comment as borderline-nuts, and I have seen no indication that any other poster has taken the reasonable position that: Dodo has, himself, repeatedly violated the rules that WP is claimed to be operating under.  
Do I believe that the average WP user goose-steps?  No, I think it's much more likely (see above)that posters tend to be self-motivated, and 'control-freaks' are powerfully-motivated to maintain an actual practice which is very different than is claimed by 'rule' or ostensible practice.  If I had more time, I'd see if I could see statistics on the persons who have posted here:  How many edits?  How many reverts?  Etc.  I feel certain a pattern is present.

Hi, Mike: I noticed your message to my talk page. I nominated this for deletion not because I doubted the accuracy or verifiability of the information contained but because I doubted the subject's notability. Wikipedia has strict guidelines with respect to whether a living person is notable enough to pass our notability requirements, and one of those guidelines requires in-depth coverage of the person in multiple reliable sources that are completely independent of the subject. So for instance, in your case if you could find in-depth reviews of you or your work in newspapers, magazines, reliable websites (not blogs, unless they're affiliated with a newspaper or magazine) or some other media that isn't related to or created by you and has editorial supervision, that would satisfy the requirements. Unfortunately, nothing that you have created yourself - your Twitter feed, your Facebook or Myspace pages, your website - is considered either a reliable or an independent source for Wikipedia's purposes.

Please note that this is a discussion for deletion, not a speedy deletion. I chose this option because this type of discussion takes seven days to grind its way toward completion, so that gives you seven days to find the independent, reliable third-party sources that Wikipedia requires.

Wikipedia also strongly discourages autobiographies: I invite you to read our guidelines on autobiography to find out why.

Speedy deletion of Emily Bierne
 A tag has been placed on Emily Bierne requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

So  I'm sure you're a really nice guy, but it looks like you're adding the tags not because of the the article needing a cleanup and reorganizing but just because the color scheme of the column boxes are not the color scheme of original boxes and are matching the Roc Nation colors and of the logo.

That is just plain out bias it not my fault that other people do not do this when creating a record label singles discography, which they can and you have not seen one with a color scheme on them. All I have done is put the 3 basic colors Black, Red and White of Roc Nation on a original Wikipedia column to distinguish it from other record label singles discography and the other names of the artists that are on the article, because the article would grow as those and more artist release more singles and songs, which makes it appropriate and not inappropriate as you have stated for you reason of adding cleanup/reorganize tags. Once again all I did is add 3 basic colors to the original columns Black, Red and White which anybody can do on any other record label discographies on Wikipedia, but I may have been the first to do this new color scheme styling of a record label singles discography that does not mean you just add tags that are not meant to be on a specific article that is formatted, organized and written like any other record label singles discographies on Wikipedia and is fully verified.

There is no Wikipedia rule that says this is not justified for a record label singles discography except for you , I'm sure you're a really nice guy, but this just plain bias, which Wikipedia does not condone from established editors or administrators.",toxicity

 Apotropaic exposure of female genitalia 

The La Fontaine reference seems to be wrong in several of the quoted authorities, who state it is from La Fontaine's Fables, but the illustration they refer to is from La Fontaine's Nouvelles Contes. The story in question is Le Diable de Papefiguière. The illustration by Charles Eisen was copied to decorate a late 18th century porcelain cup and saucer, which I found illustrated at  (Accessed ) where it is described as follows:

Paris cup and saucer with scenes from La Fontaine's Contes 1785-90Dark blue ground, rich gilding of scrolls, foliage trails and vases. Reserves on the cup and saucer with grisaille scenes, identified in gilt writing on the underside: on the cup """"la jument du compere pierre"""", and on the saucer """"le diable de papefiguiere"""". No marks. Height of cup 6.1 cm, diameter of saucer 12.9 cm. Circa 1785-90.

This cup is of the Sèvres """"gobelet litron"""" shape. Although unmarked, the quality of the gilding indicates one of the top Paris factories at the period, such as the Duc d'Angoulême's (Dihl & Guérhard). The two painted scenes are taken from the 1767 edition of the Contes de La Fontaine, which was pirated from the famous 1762 Fermiers Généraux one, with engravings after drawings by Charles Eisen. Le Diable de Papefiguière is the story of a devil which comes to frighten a village…

The commentators state that the woman exposes herself to fighten the demon, but I think the story is less straightforward. I haven't found an English translation yet, but it seems to me to be a variation of a well-known folk theme in which Satan/devil/demons are tricked by a cunning peasant couple. An English example would be the folk song """"The Devil and the Feathery Wife"""".  | Talk """,toxicity

Speedy deletion of Auspient\

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a company or corporation, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for companies and corporations. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Thanks to both of you. I think that the average number of national newspapers per nation (781) is way too high.

There are refinements the article could use (I'd particularly love to rewrite the """"Overview"""" section but need sources), but they don't seem pressing relative to the need to attend to other aspects of my life. Creating a fuller """"Responses"""" section would be nice, but isn't a priority for me.

I agree with your assessment that """"it's hard to learn"""" is the biggest issue with NVC.  There's also no standardized curriculum for it, and the way it's taught is constantly evolving. 

When it comes to criticism, I wish there could be some distinction between criticizing the core ideas of NVC and criticizing Rosenberg's presentation of it. Though I suppose that's a hard distinction for outsiders to make. There are a few things that Rosenberg says that I don't agree with, or ways he says things that are exaggerated, perhaps to try to shock people into seeing things differently in a teaching context  but none of those are the core of NVC, and other trainers including myself present NVC in ways that don't include those elements that are easy to take exception to, yet which still capture all the core ideas.

 Hi Busymom101; you can ask any questions about Wikipedia here on my talk, and even if I'm not around, someone will probably answer.  (Questions related to article content can be put on the talk page of the article; if no one sees them or answers, you might put a note here and someone will look in.)  Did your professor give you any of the Wikipedia handouts that explain editing to students?  There are many.

Here is some other information that might help:
 You can sign your talk page entries (not your article edits) by entering four tildes (  (Talk)  ) after them.
 Please have a look at WP:ASSIGN; it was written as an introduction for students doing course work on Wikipedia and is a good starting place.
 See also WP:BRD and WP:3RR; if you have added text that has been removed by another editor, you shouldn't continue to add it without discussing on the article talk page.
 Wikipedia has sourcing guidelines that apply to medical and health topics at WP:MEDRS; there are good sources available for the articles your class has been working on, so there is no need to use sources that aren't compliant.  If you wonder about reliable sources, you can ask on the article talk page.

 The official language box can only have Malay because Malay is the only official language.

A source that is not listed as an inline citation in an article is not a reference, it does not point to any specific text in the article. It is """"further reading"""" material unless it can be used to verify text. 

Notes and References
Shortcut:
WP:FNNR

Notes and References appear after See also (click on image for larger view).
Main page: Wikipedia:Citing sources#How to format and place citations
Contents: These sections present (1) citations that verify the information in the article, and (2) explanatory notes that would be awkward in the body text. Some articles divide this type of information into two or more separate sections; others combine it into a single section. There is no consensus establishing a particular structure when footnotes and the works cited in those footnotes are placed in separate sections.
Title: The most frequent choice is """"References""""; other articles use """"Notes"""", """"Footnotes"""", or """"Works cited"""" (in diminishing order of popularity). The title """"References"""" may be inappropriate if the section contains both explanatory notes and citations. Several alternate titles (""""Sources"""", """"Citations"""", """"Bibliography"""") may also be used, although each is problematic: """"Sources"""" may be confused with source code in computer related articles; """"Citations"""" may be confused with official awards or a summons to court; """"Bibliography"""" may be confused with a list of printed works by the subject of a biography. With the exception of """"Bibliography,"""" the heading should be plural even if it lists only a single item.[9]

Further reading
Shortcut:
WP:FURTHER
A guideline on further reading sections is proposed at Wikipedia:Further reading.
Contents: An optional bulleted list, usually alphabetized, of a reasonable number of editor-recommended publications that would help interested readers learn more about the article subject. Editors may include brief annotations. Publications listed in Further reading are cited in the same citation style used by the rest of the article. The Further reading section should not duplicate the content of the External links section, and should normally not duplicate the content of the References section, unless the References section is too long for a reader to use as part of a general reading list. This section is not intended as a repository for general references that were used to create the article content.

An excellent excellent start. There's an infobox, pictures and maps, and extensive details. I wonder if there is anything more to be added on such an incredibly famous battle?

(2) I wonder if there is any better way to organize the listing of the numbers of ships. Obviously, regular paragraph form will look quite confusing and ugly, and a table would likely take up just as much space as the list... can anything be done here?

I'm in twothree minds over this proposal. As regards redlinks, on the one hand, over the last two years of monitoring the topic, I've seen it used as a catalyst and incubator for new articles; on the other hand, it is arguable that a death reported in a WP:RS is of a person of some note, if not necessarily within our standards. On the third hand, we do get some no-hopers on the face of it, which is why we tend to allow a month for an interested editor to create an article, and then delete undeveloped entries as non-notable. In the second case, we perhaps should not interpret lack of interest as lack of notability, because it may be that interested editors are lacking; that's why the month moratorium seems to exist, as far as I can tell. andemu """,toxicity

 Is MSI Ventures """"Active""""? 

James A. Patterson was the Chairman of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., while James W. Reding was CETI's president. CETI changed its name to MSI Ventures and it is no longer qualified to do business in the State of Florida. However, MSI Ventures (also known as Molecular Separations Incorporated) is a Texas corporation and its current status is hidden behind a paywall; unlike Florida, the Texas Secretary of State's corporation records are not freely available to the public.

The article should not assert that CETI is no longer active when in fact it may be listed as """"active"""" by the Texas Secretary of State. CETI (MSI Ventures) may have a multi-million-dollar-per-year contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to dispose of nuclear waste (by passing radioactive waste through Patterson Power Cells) and the children and grandchildren and great grandchildren of James A. Patterson may be receiving generous dividend checks from MSI Ventures. And that may continue as long as they keep their mouths shut and do not challenge the oil oligopoly that keeps us, as George W. Bush has do bluntly stated, """"Addicted to oil"""". 

Molecular Separations Incorporated may be a very profitable company, and it may be operating and promoting its """"molecular separators"""" (a.k.a the Patterson Power Cell). I am deleting from the article the reference to CETI being """"no longer active"""".   """,toxicity

Fair use rationale for Image:321b.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:321b.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

If you talk about your achievements, why do you not mention that you were several times blocked (once even by Jimbo Wales) for personal attacks or incivility? Why do you keep quiet about being desysoped because of bad behaviour in a dispute relating to ethnic issues?

In relation to the latest edits in Cieszyn and Český Těšín (the Austrian census of 1910) do you still believe there were no Czechs in town or did you """"not know"""" at that time (""""… It is not a POV pushing from my side, I would do the same for the Czech minority, if some would be here. …"""")?

But the point is, when the admin is as novice as a non-admin user in a topic, any stand the admin takes is hazardous. The admin may get disturbed by the new-user's edit and he starts to wield his powers. Even worse, the admin forms a POV and pushes it through. He has the powers. And the total purpose is defeated. Instead of being objective, he may take it personal and very often quotes WIKI rules, blocks as trolls, reports as vandalism etc. to win. Becoming a WIKIPEDIA ADMIN doesn't make anyone an automatic authority on any topic. 
Its highly unfortunate that, people are becoming admins by doing minor edits and staying for longer periods on wikipedia. Once they get the adminship, the power corrupts these people. Particularly, people who still suffer from Eurocentrism , cause even more damage. This is the case that is being argued. Other admins that should be checked, as I notice, are DBACHMAN & RUDRASHARMAN. There may be many more. Unless the rules for adminship are amended to prevent this hazard, Sensitive articles continue to remain in the stranglehold of eurocentric admins.

I would find it odd, but nothing on Wikipedia surprises me that while the whole Duke nonrape was about people being “falsely accused”, Duke53 , W and others are more than willing to “falsely accuse” Crystal of being a liar.

Likewise, I may have a theory that many of the people here are liars, but I give the benefit of the doubt that they are “mistaken” and if were being checked into the mental hospital – I would give the possibility of crazy/delusional.

Iraq was falsely accused of having weapons of mass destruction. = true

Yes, true. I never used the term """"anti-vax"""" term as it is perjorative (new word for me, but just the one I've been looking for), and for that reason you wont find anyone who is anti-vax describing themselves as such. It has always been thus, eg this 1895 book by Hutton """"Anyone who adopts the cause of the """"anti-vaccinator"""" is, ipso facto, reckoned by a vast number of people—who on any other subject would judge fairly and patiently—a crank, a faddist, and a fool.""""  You can see this in front of your eyes by reading the page Midgley has created. You can see his intent by the way the more suitable and non-emotive term Vaccine Critics was deleted for this page.  He may believe sincerley that anti-vax are psychotic, but that doesn't make it OK. Also anti-vax are a small section of vaccine critics, so he is effectively deleting 90% of vaccine criticism.  And to get an idea about the term, I would have to ask people if they were happy to be termed """"anti-vax"""", as I wouldn't list them as such otherwise.  15:37, 10""",toxicity

I would suggest this as the first paragraph:

Antisemitism (also spelled anti-semitism or anti-Semitism) is prejudice against or hostility towards Jews.

Thus the term antisemitism is used only to refer to hatred of Jews; it is never used when making reference to other groups of people who might be called """"Semitic."""" The term can be spelled in the hyphenated form both with """"Semitism"""" capitalized or in lower case, but in this article an editorial decision has been made to use the unhyphenated form of the term throughout. 

I have also left off the last sentence:

""""In its extreme form, it """"attributes to the Jews an exceptional position among all other civilisations, defames them as an inferior group and denies their being part of the nation[s]"""" in which they reside.""""

For the benefit of those who may be following this discussion, I'll post my clarification from your talk page:

""""Looking at the games in order of best sales, they'd be VII, X, VIII, IX, X-2, VI, etc. Obviously Sephiroth merits his own article, and Seymour probably makes sense as well, but out of the next titles, Kuja's got one while Ultimecia, Kefka and Shuyin don't. Given this and Kuja's already substantial section on the list of FFIX's characters, as well as the fact that describing IX's story comprehensively will require a pretty thorough explanation of him anyway (sales figures aside, he is the central conflict of the game, really; the same can't really be said of Seifer with VIII or Seymour in X; in order for them to get proper coverage, they'd have to get their own articles), it seems to me like him having his own article's kind of unnecessary. Any discussion of him is really a discussion of the game's story, and any discussion of the game's story is going to largely be a discussion of him, so I just think it will probably make for some somewhat unnecessary reiteration across the three articles (Final Fantasy IX, List of Final Fantasy IX characters and Kuja).

He's certainly a notable villain, though. I'm just saying that in light of the treatment of most of the other notable villains and given the already thorough treatment of Kuja's role, it seems somewhat unnecessary for him to have his own article.""""

By the way, I would say we're always POV in how we decide such matters. Deciding matters of inclusion is inherently going to be based on POV. However, that isn't a problem, as policy for neutral point of view only applies to how information's presented, not how it's selected.

It has a major music school founded by Alan Fox,  which eduates over 14,000 young people and adults with music lessons of all ability levels and instrumentations with classes and ensembles. The educational program of the school spans not only classical music but extends into pop, jazz, rhythm & blues and advocates youth orchestras and big band ensembles.  The orchestra received a grant to support """"Music After Hours"""", a consortium with the Music School geared towards educating aspiring young musicians grades 3-5 children after hours. This was put into effect in 2001.In September 2008,  the Rhode Island Philharmonic Society established the Carter Center for Music Education and Performance, located Waterman Avenue in East Providence which has over 30 private studios, including  a jazz, rock and blues wing.
Every May, the orchestra puts on 4 education concerts at VMA and groups of musicians perform at schools and community centers throughout the year.

I certainly do not have a problem with this user CORRECTING birth date years to reflect the truth, provided some kind of proof is given in the form of a link to an authoritative web site or other source.  The evidence indicates however that the changes made by this user were in fact arbitrary additions or subtractions of a year or two or ten.  It may be that the user inadvertently hit on a """"correct"""" year purely by accidental coincidence, particularly if there are """"source information"""" sites that have alternate years of birth posted as well.  But there are other cases in the contributions list where the user made a change to a false year, and then changed it back to the correct year, either to confuse the anti-vandalism patrollers, or to make the latest edit look like a true and legitimate one.  Either way, I think it would be good practice for us all to provide a reference link and edit summary any time such a change is made.

Dear Philipe, we are a group of 50 editors who have been communicating with each other via the email system. We do not wish to identify ourselves as we do not wish to be associated with drama. This is why we present this anonymously to you. Our intentions are pure and honest and we do not mean to stir up drama. We are gravely concerned regarding the hiring of Oliver Keyes to a position within the Wikimedia Foundation. He has long been known as a very difficult person to work with and he regularly engages in unsolicited attacks. We strongly feel that his hiring by the WMF is a dark stain on the part of the WMF and we strongly urge the WMF to seriously reconsider his appointment.

 The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology.  I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance. So thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to wikipedia.

 Hey What's Up 

Hey Pink Floyd guy,
I started editing on Wikipedia just to keep my mind occupied, I'm going through deep shit, when I started reading the factual errors and the sick shit like mentioning mortality, dying and suicide on the prognosis section of anorexia nervosa, I started contributing out of altruism. 

Wikipedia occupies the first spot on most searches, for self righteous, incompetent dickheads ( can I say that or am I violating WP:Dickhead?) to claim ownership and disseminate bullshit is wrong, it makes Wikipedia look bad and more importantly people are getting bullshit information. 
There is one particular individual who seems to clamor for attention, his 15 minutes of fame went to his head. All the articles he created are one sentence to a paragraph long. To up his """"look at me"""" count he merely transferred sections that other people created to make it look like an article he started. I read extensively about him, he is a publicity hound and I find his behavior pretty frigging disturbing. Soooo I'm not going anywhere. I just have to cool out with my childish hissy fits and use the WP:Blah Blah and according to WP:Yadda Yadda B.S. 

My life is a bit of a horror show right now, so I might not be able to edit anything after tonight, but don't let a dickhead screw-up what could be meaningful information for other people. Proper knowledge can help people, like your information on Rumination syndrome. Whether or not some dick (WP:Dickhead?) has a college degree or is a physician means squat. I'm going to undue some damage tonight, I think there was useful information on some of those pages if I can't get back for a while don't let dickheads fuck it up. (Can I say fuck it up?)

 Motto of the day 

Hello, I notice you're using one of the  templates, run by Wikipedia:Motto of the day. You may have noticed that some of the mottos recently have been followed by a date from 2006, or on occasion simply """"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"""". The reason for this is that Motto of the day is in some very serious need of help. Participation in the project, which has never been especially high, has dropped considerably over this past summer, to the point we have had several days where no motto was scheduled to appear at all. Over the past several weeks, I've been the only editor scheduling mottos at all, but there aren't enough comments on some of these mottos to justify their use. If we do not get some help - and soon - your daily mottos will stop. In order for us to continue updating these templates for you, we need your help.

When you get a chance between your normal editing, could you stop by our nominations page and leave a few comments on some of the mottos there, especially those that do not have any comments yet? This works very simply; you read a motto, decide whether or not you like it, and post your opinion just below the motto. That's it - no experience required, just an idea of what you personally like and what you feel reflects Wikipedia and its community. If you do have past experience with the project, then please close some of the older nominations once they've got a decent consensus going. There are directions on the nominations page on how to do this.

If you have any questions, please let me know, or post on the project's talk page. I'm looking forward to reading your comments on the suggested mottos, and any additional suggestions you'd like to make. Until then, happy editing!  (//c) """,toxicity

Speedy deletion of Kurt lockhart

 ANI 

Hello. Rather than sling my club about more on the ANI, I thought I'd drop you a message. (Please indulge me with this. But don't read as I am letting off steam more than anything.) I think my """"ban"""" proposal is actually less severe than a block. As I understand blocking, he could only work on is own user space. Indeed, sometimes blocks include the user space. But with a ban, he'd just be restricted from those category pages and others' userspace. He could edit and talk in the non-categorized (econ, etc.)  and revert obvious vandalism type stuff. Now will he agree to a voluntary ban? I doubt it. He has not reacted very positively to my proposal. Instead, """"you guys"""" must comply with his conditions, e.g., stop me, Rubin & SPECIFICO from harassing him. And consider his latest example. He cites one thread that was civil, verses the 116 diffs that I complied. (I'd proposed the Editor review to him before, but he won't do it.) Forgive me, Writ Keeper, if I complain too much here, but X goes on and on – not just on the talk pages. He creates new, lousy stuff, and then links it on other pages which have marginal relevance. (Example, his Scroogenomics article, created with three edits, and then linked here and there. So who contributed to Scroogenomics? X did 3 edits, 72Dino did 10, I did 9, Rubin, SPECIFICO, and the bot each did 1.) X asks if anyone objects to posting stuff, which can't be ignored because he'll take it as a green light for more lousy editing. Okay. I'll stop. Maybe I'll repost my . Let me know if you want to use it and I shall. Thanks so very much. –   """,toxicity

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt",toxicity

I agree that it's a contentious statement, but don't you see that it's equally contentious to assert that I """"clearly"""" acted in ways which were at best likely to mislead others? I'm under no obligation (that I'm aware of) to explicitly call out that the various IP addresses I use are all being used by me. That said, I've also never denied it.

E.g. 
My use of wikipedia being my *reading* use, as is made clear by the statement """"those orange banners are annoying."""" I didn't evade the block until such point when I thought it had been communicated that editing under a different IP wouldn't be considered evasion. As User:Dennis Brown pointed out to me, IP addresses aren't humans; they're more akin to telephone numbers. It follows that a block applied to a telephone number applies to that telephone number. If the intention was to stop me, personally, from editing Wikipedia, shouldn't it have been a ban? (Also, you must be aware that statements like """"to twist logic in your defense"""" fail to AGF.)
At this point, I'm pretty sure that everyone has taken it as granted that I'm being deceptive simply by choosing not to register for an account. If that's the case, this really doesn't seem like the encyclopedia that anyone is encouraged to edit boldly. Also, you're misconstruing what I admitted (see above.)
Lastly, (and this relates to all of your points in general), you yourself said that it was reasonable to invoke IAR (above) in order to improve Wikipedia, despite the block. If that was the case for calling attention to a bad edit, why not a bad policy?

The source coming from the peak is not appropriate as it does not support what you have written.  The article makes legal distinction between CFS BC and CFS national.

Also: """"The organizations generally brand themselves as CFS and do not make the distinction between the branches.""""
Your source does not support that statement. Also """"brand"""" is a corporate term and not NPOV language.

Also: """"In addition, it is impossible to belong to one division and not another making the CFS de-facto one organization"""" Is not supported by the one source you provided.

See the reliable sources policy: """"Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made;"""" - WP:RELY

Simon Fraser's The Peak, has a well established and long time editorial bias against CFS so I'm not sure if the article you use is even considered a reliable source.  Again check WP:RELY for all the details

Gender equality is one of this project's central concepts. It was AWOL.
(reposted from Portal_talk:Feminism)

Essentially, variations on Gender equality had been hijacked six or so months ago by redirects to both Zygarchy and Equalism, and had actually begun to affect the conversation across the internet. 

This is bad news, as these terms have nothing behind them but ill-defined assertions. I've rarely been embarrassed for Wikipedia, but this is one of those moments where the site's power was left in the hands of POV/OR mischief-makers.

""""Zygarchy"""" is a made-up word that would never meet the WP:NEO standard if anyone had caught it. It has never meant """"rule of two genders"""" before someone asserted it on Wikipedia. There are a couple hundred blogs out there crowing about the """"new word they'd learned"""" while learning less than zero about notable, verifiable internationally-established gender policy. (Somewhat ominously, """"zygarchy"""" is an obscure but genuine term for an ancient military formation involving two chariots. I think the chariots were used to run infantry over... or to cut them down with a chain between them...)

""""Equalism"""" has been used by notable sources and scholars but never consistently. There was some effort to use it to refer to communism in the fifties, anarchism at various points, and some among the Facebook crowd seem to like it better than """"feminism""""; one news citation in Sweden counts it as a subset of feminism. That is to say, it's a semantic game: There is no """"-ism"""" there, just a desire for one, a moving target without a developed philosophy behind it. I've redirected it to a far more notable article, Egalitarianism.

Nearly every instance of a wikilink to Gender equality had been piped to Equalism. That's what last night was all about for me: finding and removing the plumbing from this phantasm.

I've reestablished the Gender equality article with cites to the UN and an external link to the World Bank. I've added it to the various gender studies and feminism templates. This is one of this project's central concepts, and we really have to watch these pages. Cheers,  ✉ """,toxicity

Hello Jim,

Help please. I am new to wikipedia and surely lacking sufficient skills. I finished a new article on a new subject matter """"Virtus Economic Theory and Model"""". I used the wizard to write it. It is currently in Draft form and wished to know: a) what happens next? 
b) how do I (or someone else in Wikipedia) transform this article from a Draft status to a live one? 
c) how can I benefit from someones more experienced to look over/edit the draft - do what is necessary to turn it into a formal article.

Many thanks and all the best.

you're wrong; IAR applies to admins and regular editors alike. 
 
You have provided no evidence of that.    As I said,   I have the facts and you guys just have bullshit.
 
What is a """"regular"""" editor?    I am not a """"regular"""" editor  I am an occasional editor.
 
The """"Ignore All Rules"""" rule does not mean there can be one set of rule exceptions for you and another set of rule exceptions for me.     We can agree on an exception to the rules,  but the exception must apply equally to both of us.   For example,   we could agree that it is OK here to break the Wikipedia rule against using personal blogs as sources.    But that would mean that links to my blog must be allowed here and could not be excluded by arbitrary,  discriminatory distinctions between """"crappy"""" personal blogs and """"reputable"""" personal blogs.

 First point - it was not only treated as mental illness, but as criminal activity.
 Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, sexology,  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance, which shows the term can be taken for granted, fine - otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead. 
 Third point, my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent, because I have only come across the term 'romance' used in this context, at conferences, ironically or critically.  Just because a term is used in sources does not mean that it can be used in the lead when it is not in the text, for example, """"Homosexuals deserve to be executed or tortured""""   """,toxicity

Taking the pre-med curriculum was among the most depressing experiences of my life - a relentlessly grinding, competitive exercise in rote memorization of material that held little interest or applicability for me. I felt bad for people who took organic chemistry and biology because they were actually interested in those subjects - they were trampled in a horde of people who had come from the top of their high school classes and were trying to beat the curve, inexorably normed to a C+/B-, to get into med school.I certainly witnessed a reasonable amount of cheating, and I'm sure there were more egregious things happening out of plain sight.

That's not the case.

If I had the time or the inclination, I could spend several months quoting entries and instances on Wikipedia where editorial verbiage is used.

This is what happens when ivory-towered (and foreign) academics write articles they have no connection to.  Any 8th grade Minnesota drop-out understands who Bud Grant is and why he's significant, however international egg-heads might get the impression that this is a refined and polite sport played to illustrate the deep and shared spiritual values between the United States and our irrelevant neighbors to the north, instead of smash-mouth warfare on an American Gridiron managed by giants like Bud Grant.

That's an accurate description of the view that things relating to Greece use words (in English) derived from Greek-language Hellas on the basis that Greeks themselves prefer this term. If this were a discussion about Germans wanting everything about Germany to use Deutsche in English too, that would be a German-centric concern (i.a. a concern centered on Germany, Germans, and their preferences).  NB: I actually know Germans who insist that we should stop saying """"German"""" and """"Germany"""" (and that the Spanish should stop using Alemán), and everyone use """"Deutsche"""" and """"Deutschland"""", so, no, it is not a red herring fallacy at all, but a comparison chosen carefully (though not carefully enough; see a bit later). Your own counter however, is a straw man fallacy; no one said anything about transliterating vs. not transliterating, so the """"Ελλάς"""" argument is a complete non sequitur.  I do agree that Hellenic is an English word, and concede the point that the Deutsche comparison wasn't very apt after all; I was focused more on the situational than linguistic similarity when I chose it.  A better example would be expecting our articles about Japan and the Japanese to use Nippon and Nipponese to better match the native name of the country; these are in fact words in English. It would actually make  sense to do that than to do what's been proposed here, because """"Nipponese"""" has no confusing alternative meaning, unlike """"Hellenic"""" which commonly, probably  commonly, refers to ancient Greek culture in English, not modern.  —  ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼

 EVHS 

Hi, 

I saw you've been editing the EVHS article.  I wanted to bring a few things to your attention.  The user evhs00 has basically been copying the Los Alamos High School article.  (see for yourself).  Problem is that he's copied a great deal of stuff that does not apply to EVHS.  For instance he makes a serious of false, baseless and dubious claims:

 EVHS was one of Newsweek's 2007 """"1,000 Best High Schools in America"""" (#598).  This was baselessly copied from the LAHS article and is just false when applied to EVHS: 

http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=Rank&count;=1351&Search;=&start;=500&limit;=100&year;=2007&

 EVHS is """"mostly middle class"""".  A dubious claim considering espanola is one of the poorer cities in one of the poorest states and has 21% of its population living beneath the poverty level:

http://www.city-data.com/city/Espanola-New-Mexico.html

 Many other claims are suspect, uncited, and bear a clear similarity to claims on the LAHS article.   

Additionally, 

 The image of the sundevil mascot was taken from the Arizona State University article and is not fair use.

 The image of the basketball team was taken from the EVHS Athletics website and is not fair use. 

Basically there's no citations anywhere and the author's methodology is clearly one of blatant copying.  I really want to avoid an edit-war between rival high school articles so I'm not going to touch the EVHS article.  I'm actually really glad that somebody is working on the EVHS page.  But the author needs to learn how to work within the rules.

Evils of Atheism

It's about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine, and before you ask, I do not generalize, I think there's a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers. Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind, and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades. Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a """"Whatever gets you through the night"""" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith.

First, allow me to quote from the opening sentence of WP:V: """"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth — that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true.""""  (Emphasis mine)  By making such a judgment and using it as criteria to affect the content of the article, you are committing WP:OR.
Second, I seriously doubt that LS considers this to be literally true, as you are trying to imply.  This is evidenced by his qualification of the statement with a """"may be"""".  This is merely a succinct way of making the point that WMC gains a great deal of influence through his activities here at Wikipedia.  That is the main point and thrust of the article, and on that point yes, I truly believe that it is true.  A great many lay people actually do rely on Wikipedia for at least gaining a basic understanding of the topics that they read here.  GW should be no exception in that respect.  And to the extent that Wikiepdia influences these people's opinions and the way in which they vote in the political sphere, which again is what LS is discussing (as opposed to the science), then yes WMCs contributions for his side of the debate as well as his maligning of his opponents in their BLPs (as LS alleges) clearly could have a significant impact.

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",toxicity

The Delphic Oracle is one of the earliest stories in classical antiquity of prophetic abilities. The Pythia, the priestess presiding over the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, was believed to be able to deliver prophecies inspired by Apollo during rituals beginning in the 8th century BC.[11] It is often said that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapors rising from the ground, and that she spoke gibberish, believed to be the voice of Apollo, which priests reshaped into the enigmatic prophecies preserved in Greek literature. Other scholars believe records from the time indicate that the Pythia spoke intelligibly, and gave prophecies in her own voice.[12] The Pythia was a position served by a succession of women probably selected from amongst a guild of priestesses of the temple. The last recorded response was given in 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I ordered pagan temples to cease operation. Recent geological investigations raise the possibility that ethylene gas caused the Pythia's state of inspiration.[13]

One of the most enduring historical references to what some consider to be psychic ability is the prophecies of Michel de Nostredame (1503 – 1566), often Latinized to Nostradamus, published during the French Renaissance period. Nostradamus was a French apothecary and seer who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous worldwide and have rarely been out of print since his death. He is best known for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Taken together, his written works are known to have contained at least 6,338 quatrains or prophecies,[14] as well as at least eleven annual calendars. Most of the quatrains deal with disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles – all undated.

Nostradamus is a controversial figure. His many enthusiasts, as well as the popular press, credit him with predicting many major world events. Interest in his work is still considerable, especially in the media and in popular culture. By contrast, most academic scholars maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus' quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.[15]",toxicity

As referenced here: 480p, 720x480 and 640x480 are both 480p, the difference lies in what ratio a set or program is displayed in, 4:3 or 16:9, not what resolution. 480p, 720p and 1080p all refer to the vertical resolution, not the horizontal.
The Wii-mote's input is entirely different than the PS3 controller.  The PS3 controller's technology has been utilized in PC controllers for well over 10 years (the only difference is that the PS3's is apparently supposed to sense forward and backwards movement.)  The Wii-mote's nunhuck add-on has the same functions, but the remote itself has pixel-perfect pointing, the PS3 controller does not.

Rapid Hire Centres Limited is a supplier of tool and equipment hire in the UK as well as being a logistical and technical partner to businesses of all sizes. Operating under the banner of Rapid Hire Centres, the company has a network of 3 outlets, one in Huddersfield, one in the village of Honleyand one in the village of Elland. Rapid Hire Centres originated in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire in 1996.
History
The company was formed in 1996, by Kirk Stansfield on Leeds Road, Huddersfield. Initially known as Rapid Tool Hire, the shop focused on tool and equipment hire with a small stock of sale items.

In 2002 Kirk Stansfield joined forces with his friend Andrew Jones and opened a second shop in the village of Honley near Holmfirth. Kirk Stansfield opened another shop in 2007 in the village of Elland near [[Halifax]. Andrew jones built up the sales side of the business, which now accounts for half of the company's turnover. During the 2007 Recession the building industry was in decline and it was decided soon after by the owners to set up an internet site selling tools and equipment, this would give Rapid Hire Centres a larger customer base, and would save jobs. Rapid Tools Direct UK was formed by Kirk Stansfield and Andrew Jones in 2009. The company now services customers throughout the UK.",toxicity

The scope of the project expands to more than just SCUMM games. Rewritten from C to C++ starting in 2002, addition of a GUI, etc. 
 Then the legal issues with LucasArts  this is far a more notable part of the history of the project than an alleged GPL violation many many years later  and their amicable resolution and ongoing development of the project. (That's just page 1)
 Then cooperation from games companies, sharing of source code and in some cases offering the games as freeware (a section of prose on this would provide context and make the long lists of later in the article more meaningful). ScummVM developers evening working with companies under NDAs. Merging the SCI engine goes from April fools joke to actual reality many years later.

Here's my best guess for who Slim Virgin's first account was:

I'll say why:

1) Created the Yvonne Fletcher article, just 1 minute after he had made his first edit to Pan Am Flight 103
2) Made many edits to Yvonne Fletcher article insisting that a marksman killed her, and pushing many conspiracy theories about it.  Encouraged links to Joe Vialls' sites on it.
3) Received a new user message on 14 December 2003, yet first edit wasn't until 17 January 2004, suggesting Darkaddress was in some trouble, and had edits wiped from history.
4) Basically stopped editing in July 2004.  Only made 2 edits since Slim Virgin started in November 2004.  These two edits were minor:  and , and were 6 months apart from each other.  This is suggesting that Darkaddress had a sock puppet.

Of course, this is all going with the theory that Slim Virgin is Joe Vialls.  It is just a theory.  It is at this stage a very thin theory, and I am hoping for some more meat towards it.  However, Joe Vialls is the only person I can think of who is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing and also is anti-Jews.  And, make no mistake, Joe Vialls is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing.  He is also an expert on Yvonne Fletcher.  Indeed, he is an expert on Jews themselves.  He just happens to hate them, and blame them for everything.  Joe Vialls is also a former policeman turned detective turned journalist and conspiracy theorist.  Supposedly Joe Vialls died last year.  Joe Vialls is extremely secretive, and nobody really knows who he is.  He also likes to sign his name """"JoeVialls"""".  A bit like """"SlimVirgin"""" eh.

One thing though!

Rome belongs to Greece! and that is the new world order we need to follow! It was the greek empire not roman empire who had occupy israel. As evidince we have the term """"centaurion"""" who appars in the gospel, which derives from the greek mythology. A centaurion came forth to Jesus and asked if he could heal his servant. The 'centaurion' in the gospel would supposingly be a leader of the military, a horseman. Now the centaurion asked Jesus if he could heal his servant, he said that he also had people under him. And he added, """"if i say to my people """"come"""" he comes, and if i say to my people """"go"""" he goes"""". And jesus answered: """"Truly truly i say to you, in israel i haven't found so much faith in anyone"""".

In Feb. 2014, a Walmart department manager writing a long letter published in Gawker stated, """"home office gives store managers a set amount of hours and payroll dollars that they can schedule people/pay people in each area of the store, and it is based on what the sales were in that department on that day the previous fiscal year. So even though last year was a Friday, it was snowing out, and no one was shopping, this year, on a Saturday, when its sunny out and everyone is shopping, you won't have anyone around to help you because LAST YEAR we didn't make enough money!""""

A Walmart Worker Explains Why Walmart's Customer Service Is Horrible, Gawker, Hamilton Nolan, Feb. 11, 2014.

On reflection, I just have a hard time believing this.  I'm sorry.  You mean Walmart really doesn't take into account whether it's a Friday with medium customers vs. a Saturday with a lot of customers ? ?  So, this guy is a department manager.  His job is to lead his or her team and kept the assigned area stocked and put back together after customers tear it up, to be frank about it.  Just as a guess, I think Walmart probably does have more cashiers on a Saturday.  Okay, so a customer is shopping and wants to know where something is.  So, the employee is not thrilled about helping the customer because the employee up to and including the department manager is just going to later get criticized for not getting more work done.  Point well taken.

If with the term """"social construction"""" in this sentance, the statement """"Alternative hip hop, like all genres of art, is a social construction"""" is meant to convey that any musical work one calls """"alternitive hip hop"""" happens to be the product of an agent operating under certain social conditions (as opposed to working in a vacuum), or if it is meant to establish that the term """"alternative hip hop"""" was created by such an agent, then the statement is quite true.  However, a """"social construction"""" typically is opposed to a """"natural kind"""" in that it is only conventional.  In this sense it is not altogether clear if in fact the statement is true:  take the art genres """"Oil Painting"""" and """"Punk Rock"""":  it is not merely as a point of convention that we say these two genres are different, there is a matter of fact about it.  However, in neither of these senses does it straightforwardly follow that """"as such the definition is open to debate.""""  I do not mean to contend that the definition isn't open to debate, but only that its openness to debate isn't tied in any direct way to whether it is a """"social contruction"""".

Just seeking information generally. Firstly on Tonbridge Angels' page you amended the criteria for former players to exclude captaincy, and on Margate's removed the section altogether. I'm afraid I missed the earlier section on Margate's page, my mistake. However, """"duplication"""" apart, am wondering about your reasoning of """"vague/dubious"""" as these criteria are ones I have seen on any number of non-league club pages or why the section was not deleted after the earlier addition of Barry Thornley (not by me!) which created it (the section)?

 V is not equal to IR
Facts:

1) In chemisty the number of electrons leaving a mass is determined by the voltage Source: chemistry textbook 
2) In induction physics, the current is determined by the number of coils in the winding source: physics textbooks 
3) In circiut theory the current is determined by the load Source: also physics textbook 
4) these three things are all different 
5) In the power industry, there is also something called """"current draw"""" which is a current not determined by the load but the power supply Source: Con Edison training manual 
6) All of these things with the exception of 5 are excepted theories of science that contflict with the electricity theory
7) The units for charge are wrong. The 4pi that is in F = q1*q2/(4pir^2). the 4 pi is found experimentaly but is from the units.

I find that most circuits textbooks don't even talk at all about any scientist. Many of whom pointed out alot of these things
What I demand:

1) A scientific presentation of electricity theory that uses the scientific method 
2) A list of people in the scientific community who actually accepted this (and hold electrons to be a fact and more than a theory), and on what basis of the scientific method did they accept it.""",toxicity

 US emissions description is totally contentless now. 

The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

Thanks for your feedback, Orderinchaos.

  The Tireless Contributor Barnstar I haven't left a barnstar on Wikipedia for a very long time. Sometimes when you are closely working with somebody you neglect to reward them for things that are really, really great. During my time on Wikipedia, I have seen you grow from a contributor who makes edits every now and then - almost solely contributing to Aquinas College, Perth to a wide PSA school scope. Recently I have stopped my contributions to PSA articles, for reasons both you and I know. I have realised my thank yous over the year you and I have been working together for have culminated in something a little larger. By comparison, you have probably been the editor I have worked with the most. I look forward to working with you in the future. Until then, here's a barnstar in recognition of your efforts in Australian schools articles. Soon enough, I hope to be joining your PSA watch you emailed me about.

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.

No I am not missing the point; I am disagreeing with you. Since he still uses a regnal name, the """"other clergy"""" argument doesn't fly. He was a pope and is pope emeritus, so his article's title should remain as close to the established convention as possible. The fact that he stepped down is not a compelling reason to drastically deviate. Nothing in what you say makes any logical argument for why """"Benedict XVI"""" is the best form for a pope emeritus. In other words, in the formulation """"Because X, the unmodified regnal name is the most appropriate for a pope emeritus"""", you have yet to supply X. This seems to be more about your personal preference than rules or logic. Also, since the article should match the other popes after he dies, what we are really talking about is what to call him while he is alive. Does it really make sense to drop """"Pope"""" then add it back? What is the difference? Keeping the article where it is no more suggests he is the current pope than Pope John Paul II does or that Queen Victoria suggests she remains a current monarch.

Slpl1, Please!! The situation is NOT """"an exact parallel"""" to the examples you've given, especially the first. In that example you're comparing a matter of hard science to a highly subjective jouranistic description. Basketballs to oranges. We don't have a choice as to what causes AIDS. We can't say, for example, that it is caused by a severe deficiency of Vitamin C because that would simply be false. But in the case of the men's rights movement there are all sorts of descriptions, ones used by """"scholars"""" no less, that would not be false. We could say that the MRM is a countermovement to feminism, a reaction to feminism, a response to feminism, a rebellion against feminism, etc. And, by the way, were we addressing the subject of AIDS, we also wouldn't say """"It is considered to be a caused by the HIV virus"""" would we? Rather, we would say that """"AIDS is caused by the HIV virus"""" or, to more explicitly bring in outside authority, """"AIDS has been determined to be caused by the HIV virus."""" That's because """"is considered to be"""" also brings in a degree of subjectivity to the statement.

Your second example is closer to our situation and, to be honest, it isn't all that obviously unacceptable to me. However, in the case of Holocaust denial we are almost invariably dealing with clear-cut antisemitism and scholars and editors should call a spade a spade. In the case of the MRM, I think that both scholarly and popular literature will reflect that we are not dealing with the same degree of monolithic hatred. Moreover, unlike Holocaust denial, standard issue MRM causes don't reflect a flat-out denial of historical fact.

What I see in the present """"It is considered to be a backlash to the feminist movement"""" wording, are editors taking the most negative description of the movement that they could """"get away with""""  (saving the even less acceptable """"misogynist"""" for a segment of the movement later in the lead) and then framing it in the least subjective manner that they could """"get away with"""": """"It is considered to be"""".

First of all Aro cult (nyingma.com) is not a sect of Tibetan buddhism but a group accused of gross practices by its former members and Tibetan high lamas have dismissed it as a fake. They have said that the English truck driver prophet(who set it up) is taking people associated with his activities to hell. You ignored my links to the buddhist forum moderators.

Secondly the article contains untrue information as the photo of """"Tenzin Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche"""" is in fact the other tulku, Dudjom rinpoche's own nephew. """"Tenzin Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche"""" is the other boy in the top photo named as Kyabje Dudjom Yangsi. Kyabje is just an honorary title and yangsi just means tulku (reborn) hence its not even a name. The wrong photo was mistitled by namkha.org and picked up by a few plagiarist sites later. There are many photos and documentation to prove this in the official site: dudjomba.org

If you are a person of honor and really mean that you care about not spreading false information then you'll visit """"Tenzin Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche"""" (http://www.dudjomfoundation.org/ )official site and see that the tulku is not as titled in the cult's site.

I hope it's clarified. The ideas were connected in my head, but I did not mean to imply that you want PHG banned solely or even predominantly because of incivility.

Also, to say that your main focus is not his incivility, while true, ignores the fact that it was brought up enough at ArbCom to generate a """"reprimand"""" and it has been brought up since at various talk pages as he re-invigorates old issues. And another thing, you must realise that he personally targets you because he feels personally targeted? I have tried to advise PHG to leave this whole topic area well alone for a while (~a year) until heads have utterly cooled. This won't work, however, if you follow him around tagging his articles, like the France-Japan one. Whatever the merits or value of that (I'm unsure either way yet), it demonstrates the need for a better and broader solution than the current ArbCom one.

Ever thought about """"Soviet Jews"""" phenomenum?

Real Russian people were killed only as """"rivals"""", because of _war_ and not the _holocaust_!

P.S. For homosexuals killing, mentioned above - I would have killed them all if had a chance! Really, killing homosexuals is not a sin, according to Bible. AND, homosexuality was widely spread in 20'th century Germany, so i doubt they were really persecuted... Hitler stated himself that that were Jews', who dont'let Germany win the First War, and all other casaulties were mostly accidental...

Could be integrated into either technology since the 3 catastrophes here are all related in one way or another to technology. But he also bases views that break up of nations/secession inevitable because of predicted catastrophes. So perhaps ideas could be integrated into both sections. It's really more than trivia in his overall views.

You say that Technocrats are attempting to push they're political ideas, but if you know anything about Technocracy you will know that it is avowedly A-political or Anti-political, so I don't know where you get that idea from. As for your argument that the article shouldn't talk about Technocracy's ideas and goals, etc. well I find that a bizarre suggestion. I mean, every article on Wiki about a specific group would be expected to have info on the ideas, goals and beliefs of that group. That would be like saying that the article on say, the Republican Party (United States) (or any other group we care to mention), shouldn't have any info on what that group advocates. Obviously it should have as much info as possible, the only thing that matters is that it is presented in an accurate and neutral way.
Eh, you said there existed entries on Technocracy in some encyclopaedias, can I ask which ones? As for using them as sources, I don't think we're actually meant to use one encyclopaedia to write another, as that would be getting the info second or third had, and the other encyclopaedias must have eventually derived their knowledge of Technocracy from the movement itself and it's literature, so I see no reason not to simply present that info first had. Besides, I've not seen any online encyclopaedias that have better information about Technocracy than this article, I believe I've seen brief overviews, but nothing of any great detail (of-course if you know of any articles that have potentially useful info, then go ahead and present it).

Obviously, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia only people with proprietary interest in an article can edit. You're part of the problem. Underwood had an effect on the church, or at bare minimum is an 'in-joke' therefore there should be mention of him in the article. I can see your mind is made up though, so I'll save my breath, there's no point having integrity when surrounded by folks determined to enforce their bias and other folks too busy to research the subject properly (it took you several minutes to research hundreds of posts and relationships between church members and Underwood). I'm done. Your arrogance is plain as day. I didn't claim to have made a perfect edit, I even suggested re-editing in the talk page. However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition. I'm not opposed to the Church, I just think that articles deserve more than custodial opinions by caretaker editors who have a vested interest in the outcome of the article. You were just in too big a hurry. I have a fair amount of experience editing, and know that a mention shouldn't require a full-on assault to accomplish when there is proof of association.

Origins
The genesis of this page was as the cobbled together embarrassment of an article List of Charmed episodes as it was constituted around the new year of 2009. (See also: Talk:List_of_Charmed_episodes#Article_split_into_subpages and the following section of Talk:List of Charmed episodes) Subsequent systematic improvements to the inadequate alledged synopses of that page gradually showed by late in the month, the page needed split. Subsequently, the list of episodes was split out into four seasons pages, and concurrently work began transforming that page into a page with a table of articles, without the synopses, which will be handled by pages like this one.

These subpages are named to form the series links:

Clearly not, therwise I would not have been tagging.
About the references: all your references are press releases or announcements by the organizing committee. In most cases, these are not useful as sources. The article misses independent, reliable third party sources.
About the copy-editing: the text contain, amongst others, peacock terms, like """"affordably-priced items"""", """"Free to attend"""", and a list of non-notable performers. Maybe the performers are of huge local interest, they are not relevant for wikipedia. Also, the article lacks internal links.
About notability: without proper sources, notability can not be judged. A three year old festival with 12.000 visitors is not very convincing. The festivals should show that is more on offer then being just another local festival.
Still, it might by that the festival is notable. That is why I not nominated it for deletion, but that I tagged it. Now you can work on the article, without the immediate threat of removal.

The page in question is Jewish Bolshevism, which is a so called noun + adjetive expression (according to Wikipedians). The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites. My position is simple: Jewish Bolshivism has only an antisemitic meaning, interpretation, usage, justification, etc. I am not responsible for the fact that that Draius/red (whatever his difficult to remember name is) user deduced that I have insulted him.

It was generally felt by prohibition leaders that since the league acted as the agent of the churches and was therefore engaged upon the Lord's business, anything was justified which might help gain the ends desired by the Almighty.""""

The Saskatchewan Party is a centre-right political party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.  The party was established in 1997 by a coalition of former Progressive Conservative and Liberal members and supporters who sought to remove the New Democratic Party from power.  While it has been a conservative party since its creation, it is now attempting to attract centrist voters.  The Saskatchewan Party serves as the province's Official Opposition, holding 26 of the 58 seats in the province's Legislative Assembly in Regina.

Yes it was sourced to a blog, but I think it was reliable.  It has been published on the blog for a year and it is sourced to a court transcript. The pro se litigant was a Yale grad. The blog owner is a 3rd year law student and I don't think he would misquote a federal judge.  Isn't there a way to use that source, with whatever notations?

My statements of views are merely responding to yours.  You write """"I did write that the CA rule creates a double standard, because it does. It says one set of rules governs how the court must act when all parties are represented by counsel, and another set applies to pro se litigants."""".  I don't think that is true. What rule are your referring to?  To the best of my knowledge all the written rules are exactly the same in all courts for both pro ses and attorney except for 1.) ECF, which pro ses are frequently not allowed to use, 2.) pro se forms, which  pro ses aren't required to use.  An attorney could probably use the pro se forms if they wanted. 3.) appellate appendixes  in pro se cases the entire case file is sent over and there is no provision for joint appendixes, a disadvantage for pro ses.  There are also other procedures for pro ses, which are not in the rulessee the appellate procedures which I quoted from the case manuals. As I read the California manual, it seemed merely to instruct the judges to provide more explanation.  I don't remember reading anything that seemed to indicate that a pro se paper would be processed but the same paper from an attorney would be dismissed.

Criminal legislation is supposed to be clear.  A crime is supposed to be a crime no matter who does it unless they are mentally ill or a child.

If someone is jailed for disrupting a court, the Federal Rules require that the court say what the disruption consists of, so there should not be a question of what it was.

Please give me an example of a court order that you think a person can be jailed for not obeying, other than not paying alimony or child support, or not testifying when subpoened about a crime or not responding to a subpoena by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   """,toxicity

What evidence is there for any concepts?  Again, none of this debate really matters in the absence of sources.  What specific sources support specific TCM concepts?  What sources support """"cold herbs"""" having antibiotic or anti-inflammatory properties?  What sources support a """"heat pattern"""" being inflammation (aside from the trivial observation that inflamed areas are warm)?  Without sources, these abstract discussions are pretty pointless.  If a reliable source echoes your assertion, for me the only real question becomes how to summarize it.
The assertion that TCM is speaking a different language rather than simply """"right by accident"""" is also an assertion that requires a source.  All prescientific medicine usually manages to be correct about certain herbs, be they emetics, analgesics, laxatives or soporifics, but that doesn't validate the medical system.  And if we're debating the modern medical model, when modern medicine was introduced to China I believe that, like all nations, they experienced a considerable boom in longevity, a drop in infectious diseases and a much higher rate of survival out of childhood.  Mao brought back TCM for political reasons, not because it was as effective as vaccinations, surgery and drugs.

It arrives in America with the emigration of groups like the Saxons of Missouri and Grabau's group in Western New York. Folk like F.C.D.

 100 years of women in transport 

Hi,

The campaign is a celebration of the role that women have played in the transport industry as a whole. However, the number of women that entered the transport industry - 100,000 is the number of the UK. 
Could we agree on this so I can edit it back and place """"United Kingdom"""" in the right place?
At the moment, after you edited it, it says: 

The 100 Years of women in transport campaign (or YOWIT) is a celebration of the significant role that women have played in the transport industry over the past 100 years in the United Kingdom, following the centennial anniversary of the First World War, when 100,000 women entered the Transport industry to take on the responsibilities held by men who enlisted for military service.

My suggestion is:

The 100 Years of women in transport campaign (or YOWIT) is a celebration of the significant role that women have played in the transport industry over the past 100 years, following the centennial anniversary of the First World War, when 100,000 women entered the United Kingdom's transport industry to take on the responsibilities held by men who enlisted for military service.

Regarding the google rankings, I don't see how you can divorce the """"Cork City"""" hits from the """"Cork County"""" hits.  Which is a very relevant distinction.  On whatlinkshere, there are 1100 inlinks to city and 800 to county; pretty close.  If there were no other convention, then Cork would already be a disambiguation page even without cork (material) to contend with.  However, the overriding convention appears to be (Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (Ireland-related articles)#Disambiguation of locations in Ireland):
Where a town and county have the same name, the county article should be named as County Countyname, and the town should be located at County/townname (if no further disambiguation is needed). For example, Sligo and County Sligo.
It's only a talk-page suggestion, but absent anything stronger it's unexceptionable.  However, throw cork (material) back into the mix and it's clear that it's not a contest between material and city; it's a contest between material, city and county.  To me is a clear case where disambiguation is required, as the only reason city is preferred to county is a very obscure and largely arbiitratry Wikipedia convention.   """,toxicity

no referrences to  Obstruction of justice huh? 
The article should clearly mention the great effort the Bush administration made of hiding all the evidence. This was the main embodyment of the attack. Obstruction of justice of this scale is a far bigger crime as murder.

Like said earlier, this is not an issue of a """"hypothetical problem,"""" or simply put, """"If it aint broke dont fix it,"""" but an issue of Wikipedia policies and standards.  Thank you.

The FIDESZ-MPP are nationalists, and very likely ultra-nationalists. Why? First of all, a number of mass media articles and other coverage, both domestic (Hungarian) and foreign, have concluded, based on their actions, statements, rallies, and their own admission, that they are nationalists or ultra-nationalists. Something I witnessed in Budapest during the elections in 2002: FIDESZ-MPSZ (the part after the hyphen has changed over and over) told their voters, most of whom do not deny being nationalists, to wear the national colors pin, or cocard, and carry Hungarian flags during the elections, at all times if possible, to show that they are true, patriotic Hungarians, unlike the MSZP and their junior SZDSZ, who, acccording to FIDESZ, are traitors of the nation!!! Of the total Hungarian voting population at least 50% of them favor MSZP, SZDSZ, and an assortium of other progressive parties or the relatively moderate MDF! In fact, Mrs. Ibolya David, head of the MDF (Magyar Demokrata Forum) broke up with Mr. Viktor Orban and have since been bitter rivals for the affections of the right-wing voters!!! Anyway, I will not put the term """"nationalists"""" or """"ultra-nationalists"""" myself, since I was the first to notice the ommission, but I strongly suggest it should be done for historic accuracy's sake. FIDESZ-MPP are more like Austrian Jorg Haider's Freedom Party than Wolfgang Schussel's Conservative Party.

The current full official names of the organization are simply Ezras Torah in Hebrew and Torah Relief Society in English as can be seen at http://www.ezrastorah.org/about_us.php and in their mailings.  

(Mossad) Ezras Torah was founded in August 1915 and was known by that name in numerous Yiddish and Hebrew news articles, advertisements and publications from the early 20th century.  Ezras Torah's own publications (see the links to the hebrewbooks.org documents on the wiki page) also mention just Ezras Torah without any addendum.  One can also see """"Ezras Torah Fund"""" without any additional title listed in page 45 of the following PDF document American Jewish Yearbook, 1921-1922 (Directories).
The organization was incorporated in early 1920 under the name Torah Relief Society.  The incorporation document can be found in New York City's Division of Old Records in Manhattan.

I can think of three possibilities re: """"for Relief of European and Palestinian Rabbis""""
1) The 1936 volume by Julius Caesar Schwarz was giving a description and not adding to the title
2) That book was in error
3) Ezras Torah had a different official name in the mid-20th century (this would need to be supported by official documents or from material published by Ezras Torah)

If either of the first two possibilities were correct then the later English language publications listed above might have just copied the lengthened organization name from earlier English language sources without consulting more authoritative sources.

 Request for Mediation 

The following has been inserted into Requestd for Mediation - Please participate by Weighing it there.

Mediation is requested to resolve one question - whether the following sentence can be included in the authoritative voice.

"""" However, were similar circumstances to be repeated in America, the scale of the disaster likely would be less      — the Chernobyl reactors were unstable RBMKs, unlike American plants, and the Chernobyl reactors did not have containment buildings around them.] """"

In spite of 4 references which posit this opinion - it remains the opinion of the positors, and is not independantly verifyable. The use of weasel the word """"likely"""" does not grant immunity from verifiability requirments. As no one has shown how this assertion could be veryfied, it ought to be properly couched and dressed in counterclaims - which have been deleted.

My sense is the parties (4) are all open to mediation.

 NPOV dispute 

Just so this isn't lost by the two suspiciously tangential talk page sections added just above this one, here is a minor sample of the current NPOV dispute over this article. In my interpretation, the early October version of this article was rewritten with a load of weasle words which downplay criticm of the phrase's usage, and subtly play up the dubious narrative genre. More mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed. The article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a """"conspiracy theory"""" is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre. Also, """"generally and """"commonly considered"""" in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for NPOV.

Concerning the deletion of information: you deleted the """"Program for 1st Annual Workshop on Geoethical Nanotechnology"""" page and merely left links to the videos, hence no one would even know the circumstances of how the video came about or when it was made; with Jason Rennie's interview you deleted everything except a link to an archived Archive.org page which doesn't even have a working link to the audio (talk about incompetence); and so on it goes.

 You removed a ref that was to the official site and where it was available online are replaced it with a book.
 I do relise that when a revert happens, a person gets a notice.  I was hoping you would spot the obvious error (#1) atleast,  but alas, you bark out idiot.
I haven't clue why you did this as there was no reason.   I just fixed Angel (Madonna song).    
 First of all, try to understand why it was done. Did you open this reference and see whether Angel is present here at all or not? Guess not. Second of all, the book reference is the one to be used, PROMUSICAE be damned or not. Thirdly, hung medien is NOT the official site for old song in Spain, they post from 2004 onwards.

I just have to ask if its fair that I be punished so intensely for their reactions to what I said, especially when there is a power disparity with them able to block based on their reactions, and me only able to appeal on this page.",toxicity

So I concur with Vartan, and any neutral user can't do otherwise when De Waal has been used more than his notability would allow as sole source in countless articles. As he is a sole source, he can therefore be considered as having fringe position and removed unless Grandmaster or Atabek have any other works substantiating the personal opinions of De Waal who supports fringe positions in various issues including Shushi or the Armenian Genocide. The fact that he presents the Armenian Genocide as an Armenian position and compares it to a fabrication of the 60s of an alleged 2.5 million Azeri exterminated by Armenians alone would be enough to dismiss his position for that particular period of history.

The thing is, the USPS address does not necessarily correlate with the actual location of a place. People editing articles related to the United States need to understand this and accept any edits that, while using reliable sources (maps + street address), demonstrate that the actual municipality/CDP/location is not within the city indicated in the USPS address.

 Google hits 

As of November 14, 2007, Google generated 665,000 webhits on the phrase and YouTube had 610 videos.
(edit summary) Restore text cited to a reliable source

Just because the text is cited to a reliable source does not mean it merits inclusion. There is no encyclopedic value to citing how many Google hits a term gets, for a number of reasons. First, the source does not appear to give the exact way the phrase was entered, and thus the result is meaningless  it is very easy to manipulate Google results. Second, because the date is past and we cannot view the results, there is no telling how many of those hits were relevant to the topic and how many were not  the phrase is not so uncommon that it is unfeasible that many of them would not be relevant. Third, it is not really relevant  if the subject is notable in itself, then its presence on the Internet should be more or less a given and a Google test tells us nothing.

As I said, just because there is a citation for something doesn't mean there is a reason to include it. If there is a compelling reason why this information should actually be included, please produce it. -  """,toxicity

Maybe Tim could be the judge on what is the most suitable. Just to clarify the error in VH&W;, the omission of DQ2.2 (DQA1*02, DQB1*02) was a small error, the statement that (DQA1*05 without DQB1*02) was a """"partial DQ2"""" is an error. To understand why this is an error one has to read  which basically found that all DQA1*0501 previously type in Europe split 2 ways, DQA1*0501:DQB1*0201 and DQA1*0505:DQB1*0301 (I was scolded by a referee for not knowing this and not knowing DQA1*0505 and DQA1*0501
were process to DQA1*05) DQA1*0505 is part of the DR5-DQ7 haplotype, therefore in assigning DQA1*05 without DQ2, it is a DQ7.

The """"neat, plausible and wrong"""" solution will only work up until DQ2.2 hits the reviewed literature, then it needs to be dealt with. At 4% of all coeliacs it may never reach that level of appreciation. yap 20:13""",toxicity

I think the Gregorian mission mentioned in the lead needs just a word or two of explanation, such as """"... to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity"""", or similar.

""""He was consecrated archbishop during the lifetime of his predecessor, Augustine of Canterbury. He continued efforts to coordinate with the native bishops of Britain, although his efforts were unsuccessful.""""

I inserted """"British Commonwealth"""" into those sentences, about the North African campaign and the make-up of the Eighth Army! In fact, I have fought for quite a while to have """"British Commonwealth"""" used in WW2 articles, when it is factually correct, rather than the technically incorrect """"British Empire"""" or """"British and Commonwealth"""". It's an ongoing battle. Use of """"British Commonwealth"""" in infoboxes is justified in cases such as the British Pacific Fleet (active in 1945), Commonwealth Corps (invasion of Japan) and the 1st Commonwealth Division (in the Korean War), where units were specifically organised along those lines. However, in the Pacific between mid-1942 and early 1945, the UK representation was almost negligible (a couple of RAF squadrons and some army/naval special forces): the South West Pacific Area (command) under MacArthur, during 1942, was almost 100% Australian; New Zealand was the second string in Nimitz's command, the Pacific Ocean Areas (command) and; in the Aleutians campaign it was all US and Canadian forces. Use of British Commonwealth in such cases, or at the global level, conveys two false impressions: that the """"British"""" were somehow involved at all times in all theatres and that the """"British Commonwealth"""" was a primary military/political organisation, when the forces of a particular Dominion were very often alone in joint commands with the U.S. Therefore """"Allies"""" and """"Allied"""" make more sense and are more accurate than """"British Commonwealth"""" or any of the anachronistic alternatives.  | Talk """,toxicity

Eichenwald

One thing that caught my attention when I read the NYT article was the claim that Justin gave his """"customer records"""" to the Times, and they checked the 1500 """"pedophiles"""" and found they were from all walks of life.  Now, at the time Justin shut down his porn operation, he was a legal adult, and was running a web site indistinguishable from any other pay adult site, replete with the required notice that """"All Models are over 18 years of age, records on file.""""  Does that mean that anyone who paid for access to that Web site with a credit card got lumped in with the people who paid Justin for webcam performances when he was 14?  This is the kind of shoddy agenda-laden reporting typical in these cases.  Does anyone remember when the US government busted an age verification service because two web sites that used their codes, located in foreign countries, had underage material on them?  They then characterized everyone who'd bought an age verification code as """"people who had paid for access to child porn,"""" and shopped the customer list around to a bunch of other countries for sting operations.

Any reporting on alleged child porn in the US suffers from a number of problems, most notable of which is the fact that even journalists are legally prohibited from looking at the material in question to report to readers whether its content is being lied about.  It's basically a situation in which you can write anything, no matter how outrageous, about """"international pedophile rings"""" and """"luring"""" and """"poor little abused children"""" and it will get published with no fact-checking, and in an environment in which no one can be publicly suspicious about its claims, for fear of attracting negative attention to themselves.

I haven't seen a single article in the mainstream press in the last ten years on the subject of child porn that wasn't deliberately inflammatory, dripping with value-laden terminology, and full of deliberate lying by omission, juxtiposition, and innuendo.  Mr. Eichenwald's relationship with Justin Berry clearly violated almost every rule of objective journalism.  Given that the NY Times article is a single source for the entire Justin Berry story, basing an encyclopedia article solely on that article, and on derivative journalism generated by it, is an example of """"truthiness,"""" not """"factiness.""""

I think if we reorganize the page like the homosexual page this distinction would be more clear.  For example, it would make clear that reproduction results from heterosexual sex, not from a heterosexual orientation.

Its highly regretable that people are shot on our streets, and unlike some places, its not an everyday occurance.

Although we do not anticipate any more visits from Ireland, due to the proximity to North Africa there are new threats.

Hi Katie, I'd like to request an undelete on your recent deletion of this image (WP:CSD#F7). This is for two reasons:
 It's the masthead, and only, image of a biography on an important motorsport and motorboat figure. Our precedent is clearly that such images are considered to fall under fair-use. If the FUR wasn't up to scratch on the image, then WP:BEFORE clearly indicates that the FUR should be fixed, not the image deleted. I've seen an awful lot of these lately - images uploaded a few years ago (so probably the more important images) with FUR that was adequate at their time of upload are being purged because they don't meet todays practice, even though it's a trivial filing exercise to bring them up to standard. This hurts the encyclopedia project.
 Secondly, it wasn't notified anywhere on the article. There are templates for notifying this on the page, there's a talk: page too. Many people, myself included, have articles like this on their watch lists but we don't have every constituent image watched. Now whilst policy doesn't demand this, it would clearly be a helpful and appropriate action to place some notification onto the article, especially when it's the masthead that's under threat.

You state """"It is not possible for me to set up another account on another IP address because this is my IP address."""" No, it is not your IP address. It belongs to your organization. And your organization has lost the trust of the Wikipedia community, with its history of promotional edits and multiple people accessing the same account.

 Writer attribution for Lennon/McCartney songs 

Your edit comments that """"Authorship of Beatles's songs is difficult to ascertain precisely, except for the rule that the lead singer is the dominant writer"""" and """"Authorship of Beatles's songs is difficult to ascertain precisely, since all four, plus George Martin and others, were frequently involved in the crafting"""" are wrong on several counts.

 The official, legal credits are easy to determine: Lennon/McCartney except for some early songs which were originally credited to McCartney/Lennon. Ample sources exist and the WP infoboxes show the official L/M (or M/L) credit.
 Who actually wrote the song is pretty easy to determine for most of the songs where there is no dispute between L and M. Using various interviews and biographies as sources, L and M say what their part was. For a small minority of songs, such as """"Eleanor Rigby"""", L and M disagreed and the article describes the disputed authorship. For cases where there was a 60/40 split, adverbs like """"predominantly"""" or """"mainly"""" make sense, but not in cases where there is no dispute that L or M was the sole author.
 While it is true that the lead singer was often the main writer of an L/M song, it is not always true. """"Every Little Thing"""" is one such exception.
 Other people who contribute to a song—such as a producer or soloist—typically do not get a writing credit for their contribution. That's standard practice in the industry with rare exceptions, and there are good reasons for it. When someone makes a significant contribution, that should be discussed in the prose or in the Personnel section, i.e., """"Martin wrote the string arrangement"""" or whatever.

Your position on the L/M situation is a minority viewpoint. The authorship details you are challenging are typical of hundreds of articles that have similar prose and use similar evidence and the text in those articles have been accepted by many WP editors. That represents a strong consensus for identifying the actual author in the prose. You should seek consensus for your changes and present reliable sources that support your view. —   """,toxicity

Questioning minor 1st paragraph edits?
Re: John Roberts, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sandra Day O'Connor
This is a small matter.  I don't understand the reasons for 's recent minor edits of articles about each of the Justices of the Supreme Court.  After some time, there has been no response to inquiries posted on this editor's talk page nor has there been feedback from similar postings on the talk pages of each of the nine articles about a sitting Justice and the one about retired Justice O'Connor.  Rather than simply reverting this """"improvement,"""" I thought it best to solicit comment from others who might be interested. I found your name amongst others at Talk:Supreme Court of the United States.

I'm persuaded that 's strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is unhelpful in this narrow set of articles  that is, in Wikipedia articles about Justices of the Supreme Court. I think my reasoning might well extend as well to others on the Federal bench.  In each instance, I would question adding this information only in the first paragraph  not elsewhere in the article.  

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, please consider re-visiting articles written about the following pairs of jurists.
 A1. Benjamin Cardozo
 A2. Learned Hand
 B1. John Marshall Harlan
 B2. John Marshall Harlan II
The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty do wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. 

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

As you can see, I'm questioning relatively trivial edit; but I hope you agree that this otherwise plausible """"improvement"""" should be removed from introductory paragraphs of ten articles.  If not, why not?

Three comments about NPOV
The second paragraph in this article links to 5 specific and very negative reviews.  However, no positive reviews are provided.  Instead, readers are provided to the wiki entries for religious right, conservative and creationist.  Since Rotten Tomatoes was used as a primary source for ratings, could this sentence be updated to include at least one link to a positive film critic review?  As mentioned in Wikipedia:NPOV, even minority viewpoints cannot be completed ignored (and in this case, minority viewpoint should not be applied since the minority viewpoint is the thesis of the film).  
There seems to be a large discrepancy between film critic/scientific community reception of this film and popular opinion (user reviews) of this film.  Popular opinion votes on Internet websites are not considered a reliable source, but in this case, since Rotten Tomatoes was already used as a primary source for this portion of the article, could this section be updated to include a reference to popular reception to this film, with a link to the Rotten Tomatoes User Reviews?

It you go to the Talk Page of the Big Bill Broonzy article you will read a post I left in January of 2013 where I mentioned this issue. No one asked women if they wanted the vote - it was the Suffragettes who put the proposal on the table. Now that women in Egypt have the vote does that mean we should disenfranchise them because the European Suffragettes from one hundred years ago didn't ask them if they wanted to be represented? I was pointing out in the examples given above that representation is not served by those who are not of the group seeking representation and that representation itself is a form of dialogue that does not arrive fully formed. Airline pilots work in consultation with the civil aviation authority to improve and implement safety measures for air travel and this affects all who travel by air. People what we have here is someone who read into my post what they wished to see written and not what was actually written. I also highlighted at the Broonzy Talk Page that this issue is a point of divergence between Wikipedia editors. I mentioned in the post above that this needs to be discussed here because we (all of us here regardless of background genetics) need to ask those who are being described as """"black"""" if they wish to join this site to affect the consensus guideline.

I then over the following weekend read an article in the Wall Street Journal about this same book and it was more even handed. It made the book sound very intriguing and a good work of scholarship. So I was using Wiki as a tool to help try and see whether or not it was the author of the New Yorker article or the author of the book who was the bigot; or rather whose perspective was being presented in the article. So if Wiki said that she is some type of devout Christian or proud of her Christian heritage, I would be able to make a better determination of which article was more neutral. Or if it said that she was a Cultural Marxist ditto. This is precisely what Wiki is there to help us with.

I saw this here: Italian it is not an agglutinative language as is German,... And I found your name below it. As a linguist, I know exactly that German - as all the other germanic languages (English, Dutch asf.) - is NOT an agglutinative language. It has a complex inflection system, more complex than the Italian one, what means that it is the complete opposite of agglutinative languages. The word """"Südtirol"""" isn't just a putting-together of """"south"""" and """"tyrol"""". It is a word, that exists because of a historical developement by combining the ideas of being south and a part of Tyrol.

 Manfred I Lancia 

My apologies, but I have been finding some definite problems with the above article, which you created four or five years ago - ones which I seem unable to solve, except by what amounts to original research. I am hoping that you would still have your sources available, and be able to do better than I can.

For example, in the Career section, you wrote (and the article still says), """"He inherited part of the city of Loreto, between Tanaso and Belbo"""" (though the current mistaken link to Loreto, Marche seems to have been someone else's attempt to improve your original). So far as I can see, this should actually say, """"He inherited part of the county of Loreto, between the rivers Tanaro and Belbo"""" (my emphases), which I believe would agree with the current Italian Wikipedia version - """"Ereditò parte del Contado di Loreto, tra Tanaro e Belbo"""" - which, however, was originally translated from this English version.

There are some apparent similar problems in other parts of the article, where the current version of the Italian article (through the distorting lens of my extremely limited knowledge of Italian) again seems to read more plausibly than the English - but since the Italian editors have not cited sources for their changes, it makes them impossible to use here. 

If you can help out at all with this, it would be useful.   """,toxicity

a side note on the high art of casting the ordinary trivial, into something special
This does not mean that what Risteski wrote on the guitar is not of value. Of course there may be interesting things there. Same with other methods, etc. But this whole topic (guitar pedagogy) seems to be one, where I can get information from anyone, even my neighbor. In other words: The body of knowledge related to guitar pedagogy is, to a great extent, not specialist knowledge with easy categorization of the sources of various ideas. Hence I detest when Risteski writes """"this work will introduce a new guitar teaching philosophy on the virtue of musical-aesthetical knowledge of classical guitar music"""". What he wishes to display as something """"new"""", is rather something that I could easily learn and find, while having discussions with my friends, with a glass of wine. So 'cheers' to guitar philosophy!  

At the same time, I can look at the article and see it empty. Risteski's articles can at least provide some food for thought; and that would be a reason to include them in the external links. I suggest: let's mix a cocktail of philosophical guitar pedagogical content. Add sugar to taste!   
writing articles for wikipedia is different than writing a """"term paper"""" for school or a commentary for a newspaper or a book that you wish to have published. In all of those occaisions you as a writer are supposed to look at primary sources and material published by others, analyse them and put them togehter in ways that support your original thesis. Taking that approach to Wikipedia articles is not acceptable as it violates our no original research policy. For Wikipedia articles writers must take material and analysis that has already been published by others and create and article that reflects all current thought on the topic, giving appropriate propotion to each. 
And again, tagging an external link that does not meet our guidelines for external links onto the end of an article that is not in good shape is NOT an improvement to the article. The Red Pen of Doom """,toxicity

Try typing 'Paul Bert' into the search box in the left column of any page and click the 'Search' button (rather than pressing Enter or clicking the Go button). You'll get the search results - the article Paul Bert is first, and Oxygen toxicity is fourth. If you click the Go button instead, you go direct to the article if it exists, otherwise you get the search results as before. Try the same test searching for 'Paul Bert effect'.
There is an article on Decompression sickness - we plan to tackle that after we have finished getting Nitrogen narcosis to GA. No need to mention those in Oxygen toxicity - although all of them are summarised in Scuba diving#Effects_of_breathing_high_pressure_gas.
The partial pressure of oxygen is the trigger for OxTox: that is found by multiplying the fraction of oxygen by the ambient pressure at the depth you're at. For example, air is 21% oxygen and the pressure at 50 metres is 6 bar. So you have a partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) of 0.21 x 6 = 1.26 bar. That's safe from CNS OxTox as it's never been observed at less than 1.3 bar. Divers may use gas mixtures different from air, however - take a look at Nitrox for more information.

Hi, I see JayJG has been leaving messages on your page, with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness.  In reality, JayJG is a rabid Zionist and is trying to purge Wikipedia of any negative information about Zionism, and is trying to paint Muslims in a bad light.  Along with many of his cohorts.

The problem is that JayJG is part of the Wikipedia cabal.  When there were elections, despite massive efforts to the contrary, a number of people got a higher vote percentage than JayJG - but Jimbo Wales put him on ArbCom anyhow.  Jimbo has shown his true colors as well.

These people control Wikipedia.  They are all together, and attacking you.  No one is coming to your aid.  This is because they control Wikipedia, with Jimbo at the center, and have more or less driven off everyone else.  You are banging your head against a wall here - any massacre by Zionists against Palestinians will be covered up, disorted, justified etc., anyone who attacks an Israeli soldier will be castigated here.

My suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative, like a wiki encyclopedia that is not pro-Zionist and anti-Muslim like this one.

Notability of James Henry Benson
A tag has been placed on James Henry Benson, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   """,toxicity

This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson.

YOU should calm down. And you did insult me. You removed my comment about the anonymous insults that admin who claims he's not an admin left and altered on MY talk page. You can block me all you want, I'll be using proxies for life. Either way, I'm with a different ISP soon, so your block ends right there anyway. You are all way to triggerhappy with your so-called 'fair' judgements on users you have never really checked the backgrounds on. THAT is insulting enough by itself.

If you click the article that says History of Afghanistan their is mention of Afghanistan's connection with the Indus valley Civilazation, which has to do with India. And in this article, and other articles, their is mention how Afghanistan has Aryan heritage. And has a history of Hinduism and Buddhism. All of which I agree with. But for some odd reason, their is little mention that Afghanistan has a ethnic and cultural connection with the history and culture of India? It doesn't make sense. I mean if it has all these ties that I have mentioned, doesn't that mean that Afghanistan has connections to the history and culture of India? I am not saying it was part of the country. Because in those days their were no boarders. But wasn't it apart of the local Aryan people? Before Islam werent many people Hindu and Buddhist then here water? So wouldn't it be easier to just say, that ancient Afghanistan has a connection to Ancient India? And before you say no, remmeber something, when you click history of Afghanitan it mention's the connection with the Indus Valley Civiliazation. So that is a connection with Ancient India isn't it?

There is a big problem with adding D. Secord as an original drummer. The line reads that there were extensive auditions i.e. they may have played a gig or two.

You linked Secord to an article that I own and he is not mentioned in it. You also simply erased another reference instead of supplying a good reference.

Cretins are too stupid to understand that the usual remedy effected by antitrust litigation is to curtail or break up a market participant's dominant, anti-competitive market position.
