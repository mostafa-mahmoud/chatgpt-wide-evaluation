I fantasize about not being born and/or killing myself every single day, but I only think about it seriously every week or so. I wouldn't say I have a plan, and I don't actually hurt myself often.  I have just about every symptom of depression and ADHD in the book, but I feel like until I kill myself it's not bad enough to validate bothering other people. And the worst bit is? Because I think this way, if I ever do decide to kill myself or self harm, I will be convinced I'm doing it for attention, because I set it as a standard to get help.

25,"Curse - my take on how I feel pretty much every day The feeling of constant loneliness remains regardless of who or how I interact with others. It's the cold hand on my back that makes me put on this jacket of barriers. Guilt blankets me while I try to sleep, hindering my ability to so. It's like fighting a boxer without any fighting experience; you wouldn't try to win; you'd try to get out of that situation. It's the lack of a lightbulb in my spotlight that lets jealousy sneak in without being noticed. That's the curse. It's a storm of feelings that hit you in the face like a brick tossed by a tornado. The damage of said brick is what you want to avoid. The goal is to dodge the bricks and get as far away as possible from the storm. Though, that's not possible, it's an endless cycle of storms, one after another. Occasionally, I find myself in the eye; the calm, brickless space I like to call happiness. No matter how much I would like for it to be permanent, the eye constantly moves, eventually moving away from me. You'd have to accept the curse, though. It's never going to give you mercy or any thoughts of freedom. It's the inevitable consequence for poor progress on mental health improvement. It's like the big bang theory, except it's not a theory in this case. All of it is the result of three events that occurred in a similar timeframe. It's a law; the structure of my thoughts and feelings. A ladder of snakes; it isn't sturdy, and you risk getting severely injured if you decide to climb it. The storms, ladders, bricks, and even just the feelings themselves, are unfortunately, the fundamentals to who I am as of this moment in time.  &amp;#x200B; Sorry guys, I just needed a place to vent, and I know how kind everyone is here so I felt safer to post it here.

50,"My crippling Among Us addiction has ruined my life. Hello, I am a 14 year old boy living in Nevada, and I have a crippling addiction to the game titled as ""Among Us"". I first began my journey into Among us on January, 2019. I instantly became addicted, I was playing Among Us 24/7 every day of the week for about 6 months, until my parents decided to intervene. They grounded me, and then they sent me to my grandma's house with limited technology throughout my summer break, as a way to ween me off of Among Us. During my summer break I was suffering from intense anxiety, and depression, suicide plagued my mind as I was begging god to let me play Among Us with him in heaven. Everywhere I went, I always saw Among Us, Lego pieces, fire alarms, trash bins, I couldn't get Among Us off of my mind. My grandma found me unconscious on the floor after a failed suicide attempt, she dialed emergency services and eventually the paramedics came to take me to the ER.  My parents decided to put me in therapy, I told my therapist everything, and I am still currently seeing a therapist. My doctor prescribed me Escitalopram and buspirone to treat my anxiety and depression. Everything was going fine and I felt my life was going to turn around, but then I relapsed. I hesitantly opened Among Us up after not playing for 2 months and went to town. I played for 2 weeks straight, with my stats on Among us peaking around 4000 hours. My parents found out and they took my computer away. I went through an intense psychotic episode for 1 entire week, I was convinced that I was an innocent crew member, about to be ejected for being sus, I did not trust anyone during that 1 week. After a second trip to the ER and several therapy appointments, here I am. I am completely lost in life, all of my friends have left me, my family is losing hope, and I am contemplating suicide due to the fact that I cannot play Among Us anymore.",0,suicide

So killing myself is probably the best lifeplan i can get with. Not a poisoning or cutting myself and hope i die in like ages. I wish i had a gun, but nope, so i guss i'll just drop my body off the building on this weekend, just have to find a good spot with an access to the rooftop, which is kinda hard in Russia, since they're all locked up.

I've been avidly networking for the last 3 months with no job prospects. I just have nothing to stand out as am I. I'm a friendly face nothing more.. I can't afford anymore events, or coffees or rent or debts or anything.  Today I ate a piece of bread with mayonnaise on it. If I plan it right, my significant other will be set.

I have no idea why. i consider myself attractive and have no problems with self esteem.  im having trouble dealing with the recent increase of these horribly sad thoughts, and this is by far the worst ive ever felt through all of my depressive cycles.

I'm just so hopeless on getting things done on my own, I'm like a child  and I hate myself for that.

I had to drop out of school at 14 because I was physically unable to attend anymore, and as a result of that I'm a complete shut in with no friends and no future prospects. Treatment and therapy haven't helped, everything is a struggle, and there's no one who understands the extent of what I'm dealing with.  My girlfriend, who was also the only close friend I've ever had, broke up with me in January and has barely talked to me since then. She told me it's not my fault but I keep replaying everything I said in the week leading up to the breakup and throughout the rest of our relationship over and over and over again thinking of things I could have said or done better. I structured my entire life around her, she was my only connection to the outside world, the only one who understood my situation, and my only chance of having a normal life.  Since she stopped talking to me, I've barely eaten, I've left my house once, and everything I used to find fun has become draining. I spend almost every hour of every day thinking about what could have been if only I wasn't such a fucked up person. I'm heavily considering just ending it all in a few days. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do. Death is terrifying, and I don't want to hurt anyone anymore (my extended family is already critical of my parents for raising someone like me, and I'm fairly sure they'd get completely shunned from my family if I were to kill myself,) but I'm at a breaking point.

Usually I have work, friends, boyfriend, places to go, things to do that keep me away from here as least some of the time. But all I hear when I wake up and when I go to sleep is his laughter, laughter that should have been mine. He's disabled, so everyone ignores what he did, as if it somehow means it doesn't hurt me because ""he wasn't *trying* to hurt you."" But he DID. I look back at my life and wonder just how much he took from me and how much more he will continue to take. What's the point in continuing on if I'm just going to lose so much before it even has a chance to happen? I'll never marry, because I'll never be able to find someone willing and able to suffer through my mood swings, my depression, my complete lack of emotional control. I'm already 99% sure my bf is readying himself to end it. I'll never achieve my dreams because I lack the drive to do anything constructive for myself. I'll keep pushing people away because I'm so afraid they'll hurt me. What's the point in living in a world where people want you so little, they'll defend and protect your rapist? All I ever wanted was someone to come along who would be angry for me. Who would show me that this was not what I deserved and introduce me to peace and maybe justice.

136,"Is it possible to get euthanized?Depression started with High school. Made tons of bad grades, trouble focusing, and not bullying but teasing from folks. Dropped out of college because it was too much for me at the time. Worked terrible retail and warehouse jobs for years. Hopped from job to job looking for decent fulltime work, preferably office. Went into the Army, one of my dream careers, and failed Ait due to injury. While I refuse to reenlist due to ""stuff"" I was a somebody. I became a man, an adult, friends, a personality. I guess it was the freedom I had. When I was considered a holdover/holdunder at least. Now I'm back home with a family that never understands and neglect my feelings/emotions. It seems like I can't be happy and continue to fail at everything. It doesn't help I have social anxiety. I just want to end it all. Only thing keeping me from committing suicide is the pain I'll feel. I just want to die in my sleep or something. Had thoughts of driving into a deep river, but I fear drowning. Is there any places where euthanization is legal? I don't want to live anymore. I don't care how my family feels because they never consider how I feel about anything.

During college I drank and I did just about any drug I could find, just to feel myself float away.   Now I'm sobering up, and I feel like I'm in high school again.

The switch flips without warning. one moment I'm fine, happy even, the next I've completely lost it.   I see a therapist and I'm on Effexor and Lithium Carbonate, but I don't feel like I have any coping skills. I've tried DBT (due to my family dynamic, several therapists have told me I have borderline personality disorder), but I need something else.  I was thinking of having myself committed for observation.  But I'm not from the area and don't know where I should go.  I don't want to be shut in a room and ignored, that'd be a waste of time. And when I was in high school, I feel that my problems were overlooked because they didn't seem as serious as those of the other kids in the ward. Also, in high school, my goal was not to get better, but to get released before any of the kids at school noticed I was gone.

I then replied: ""Bruh he's slower than his metabolism."" I admit, it was rude. Later, this other kid I've known since primary school, let's call him Simon, kicked me in the back. It didn't hurt to be honest. When I got on the bus, Simon said ""sit here and I'll kick you"" so I kicked him in the shin and went to the front of the bus. So, the next day, I told my friend about it and he asked me ""which joke?"" and so I repeated it. Jack then told Simon again and he tried kicking me in the no-no square. It didn't connect much so it didn't hurt.  The other day, I apologised to my old friend. He was chill with it. So, last week, I was tapping Jack trying to get his attention, so he elbowed me. I then said ""Yeah he's being a bit of a piss baby."" and he was mad.  Then today, I told my dad about it and I ended up going down to this other kid, let's call him Zack, 's house. Me and my mother had a conversations with his mother and she didn't believe it until I showed her the texts and showed her that the voicemail said Zack's name. I don't know what's gonna happen to Zack but I hope it's bad. We've been friends for 2 years. Meeting up at each other's houses to go to school, him coming over to mine and going on walks with him.  Now, Jack is saying I hit Simon first and I was constantly swearing at him, which is a complete lie, and now Zack has told a teacher and Jack's gonna tell the head teacher. I do have the texts to back up my claim of being harassed and bullied but unfortunately no evidence of being kicked by Simon If things don't go my way, I'm done for, big time I'm stressing like hell, I can't sleep and my legs are constantly shaking.

I came here for work, have no friends here.  I'm in my dream job but it just seems like nothing fucking matters anymore.  I can toil away in this job for some purpose no one will recognize, go home to my empty apartment in this city I do not know.  I am so lonely and am just unable to cope with it in any reasonable way right now.  Yes, life is hard, but for what?  What difference does it make if I live and work and survive some unnotable existence that leaves no mark on anyone - a life where I've pushed away those that care about me and been rejected by those I care about?  Does it really matter in the long run if I stick around for 60 more years of that or just go right now?

However after what they have said today im not sure if I should even bother to continue, I've got a massive list of punishments and I'm not allowed to see my friends for the next 2 months or celebrate my birthday next week, so if it's not going to improve would it really just be easier to end it now.",1,suicide

267,"I survived yesterdayHello reddit! I have no one to really talk to so I'm taking my thoughts here... Yesterday I survived my first and hopefully only suicide attempt. For context, I'm a 19 year old male college student in the USA. Generally, my life should seem tolerable to people on the outside. I have a super supportive family, I go to a great college, I love writing my own metal and rock music and dogs are my everything. I pretty much have my entire future set.  On the flip side, I only have one friend, but he's been my best friend for many years. This never really bothered me because I've always enjoyed being alone and never really felt comfortable in large social groups. As per dating, I've never had a girlfriend, which is totally my fault due to lack of confidence. While all this seems great, I've been diagnosed with OCD, Anxiety, and Depression. I of course take medication and try my best to stay proactive. However, it's extremely hard to get out of your own head. I know I have the opportunity to be happy. I know I can try harder to be sociable. Unfortunately, I decided to take my own life yesterday. I finally had enough. My bottled up emotions got the best of me and I couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't about wanting to be dead, as much as me wanting an escape more than anything.  While I won't get into the specifics as to what went down as I don't want to encourage suicide, my whole perspective on life has changed. I can truly say that my experience scared me. I realized I'd rather be alive for the sake of living life as compared to dying for the sake of being dead. I know many of the people reading this are sick of hearing that it will get better. While I can't guarantee you it gets better, I can guarantee that your perspective on life changes over time. It's really cool to see your perspective change, and hopefully change for the better. Please stick around to see your story unravel. Maybe it will be a story worth telling one day :)",1,suicide

But I bottle it up and bury it deep, because although I'm a worthless excuse of a person, I still feel the need to no put my family and (very few) friends through what comes after a person commits suicide.

I'm in college now, and my mother has been guilt-tripping me about how much it costs her me being here. Little does she know she's only contributing arguments to the side of me that wants the jump off a fucking building. The more my life goes down the toilet the more I see suicide as a relief, not only to me, but to every other life I manage to ruin by proxy. After all, all I've done so far of any significance is weigh people that I love down. Wouldn't it be a kindness to get this obstacle out of their way? Is it really *that* selfish?

It's held me back from everything I have ever wanted to do. I'm constantly at war with my mental illnesses which I've discovered are who I am. I was never anything else. Over the years came more difficulties and with the difficulties my mental state has worsened to an obvious degree. No one acknowledges it. I was off work for almost a year because I tried to kill myself and no one even asks if I'm ok.

Whatever you call it, it's fucked up. Not a high pressure school but terrible with mental health care. No unit in health class or anything. This year we don't even have a guidance counselor. Every time someone commits suicide, the school barely does anything. They just show an anti-bullying video in class (why is bullying *always* the cop out explanation for teen suicides nowadays?) and that's it. Last time it happened, my sophomore year, some teachers even said we couldn't talk about it. We go to a small school of like 350 total so you kinda know everyone so it's crazy when someone does it. Well this year is ""the year"" and its morbid as fuck but people keep wondering who it will be. It's been consistently every other year all this time. I could do it. I could be the last maybe too. I leave a big note, saying they need stronger resources and mental health education. Send my note to the local newspaper get it on social media. Talk about all the suicides. Say it's a big part their fault for terrible resources and ed. I'm a really involved student. They wouldn't expect me to die. But leaving that note they'd read it. It would be published so they'd have to acknowledge it. They'd have to get a counselor, set up support groups whatever. They'd have to actually acknowledge my suicide and talk about it bc public would know all too.  You can say I could do that now but they don't listen. They only listen once you're dead. A big statement to try to save others from suicide too. They don't deserve it but I do",1,suicide

If you had asked me ten years ago, I would have said it was impossible that I'd  consider suicide. I've been dealing with depression for the last five years of my life. Attempted therapy until I could no longer afford it. I live in a third world country.  My husband has been very patient with my mood changes and depression. He takes care of many things around the house. He has cooked food for us almost everyday since the quarantine started. My family is on the other side of the continent. My husband has a way of dealing with feeling I don't fully understand . He is quite reserved with his worries. It makes me admire him in a way, but also feel a bit more toxic when I voice my negative thoughts. I feel very guilty about the harm it will do to him and my mother.

I was told at the beginning of the year that I had to raise my gpa in my major in order to graduate. I thought I was on the right track, but I got my grades today, another D. Now I cant graduate, I won't be able to raise the grades enough, and my scholarship runs out at the end of this coming semester. My family can't afford another semester, and they've already sacrificed enough for me. My girlfriend has had to balance her own life and troubles in addition to mine. I feel like I don't have a future, I won't be able to graduate, and I'm not even sure I can transfer credits in my major to another university. I'm a burden in everyone's lives and and people have made enough gambles on me that i havent returned on. Lately I've been feeling like they'd be better off without me. This is the first time thoughts of removing myself from the equation have entered into my head in a long long time, but its starting to make more and more sense. They'd all be better off without me, my girlfriend wouldn't have to deal with all my emotional shit, my family wouldn't be throwing thousands of dollars down the drain because of me. I don't know, I'm not sure I even have enough courage to do it, I just want to fade away and not even be a factor in anyone's life anymore. I dont know what to do",1,suicide

Just a muted numbness. I have been staring at the veins in my wrists, so close to the surface since my limbs are so thin, and have the burning urge to take a kitchen knife to them. Get high and bleed out. I'm out of any drugs stronger than weed, so can't really OD on anything. Scared to hang myself, I have asthma and the sensation of choking makes me panic. I want to light up then go to work carving. I am at my parents right now, but that still isn't enough to stop me. I am rambling now. I could really never see myself living into afulthood anyways, I might as well put an end to it myself. I feel... calm. Maybe more calm than I have felt in awhile. I feel so outside of my head currently, like I am many layers removed from myself. Memories don't seem like my own. I can't remember how I should feel, or why I was ever so content with living.

434,"""It will get better""? I don't even care. It's just not worth it.TL;DR: Even when you expect nothing, this world still finds a way to f...ck you up. Some days will be better, some will be as shitty as this day again. So why fight through the shitty days just to wait for the few less shitty ones? It's not worth it.  Longer version: It just... doesn't matter. At least not for me. I've been working my ass off to help other people for my whole life, I always put others first. I even chose a career that involves helping people. But a few months ago, I met someone who - for the first time ever - made me think that maybe, just maybe, I could have something beautiful in my life, too. I thought that maybe, after years and years of giving, this world might actually give something back, something really good. Never before I had hoped for that. And I fell in love, and he even loved me back. And it felt like destiny. We immediately felt connected, as if we were meant to be together. Almost like a f...ing disney movie! But it turned out that before we met, there was another women. He doesn't love her, they have the worst arguments and hardly get along, he even stated that she's basically the opposite of me. But she's pregnant. So... since he's a good person, he decided to go with her and try to work things out because he thinks it'd be the best for the child to have both parents being together. So we parted. And we both cried like children. And now I'm supposed to just go on, knowing that there is someone in this world I'd be happy with and he'd be happy with me, but it just can't be. God, I'm devastated. I know, it won't feel this way forever, but I don't even want to pick up the threads of my old life. I was okay back then, with no expectations whatsoever, just hoping to help others. I expected nothing and I accepted that this world is a shitty place, but this world managed to get my hopes up just to punch me in the face. I know, it will get better, but it's just not worth it.

450,"Strict Parenting leads to a shitty childGrowing up my parents were strict. Strict to the point where I lived in fear of them. I didn't know that parents actually showed affection to their kids, I didn't know that parents actually bought their kids toys and didn't call them spoiled brats all the time. I didn't know that parents didn't throw heavy objects at their children when they wanted them to shut up. I didn't know that children weren't supposed to sleep in the garage and that it wasn't normal for kids to get kicked out of their house with nothing but their pajamas in the middle of winter. This fear of my parents fucked me up more than anything in my life. I grew up seeing other kids with loving families and happy homes while I grew up with abuse and the regret of being alive. I'm going to hang myself soon, as a final fuck you to my parents for stealing my happiness.

He'd skip around in that skimpy outfit. That tie always made him look so sexy. It was always just a fantasy though, or so I thought... I never imagined this could really happen.

We knew Squidward could walk in at any moment, what we were doing was so dangerous But that made it so much more enjoyable. With one more thrust, Spongebob exploded in me. I looked behind and saw his devilish smirk. I expected after this to pretend it never happened... but Spongebob didn't like that idea. For the next few weeks, we were having the time of our lives.

605,"Just need some advice to stop feeling depressed and suicidal...So yea. I'm suicidal at times, but thankfully I'm much better now... But still, I feel depressed almost everyday. I don't know why sometimes. I guess you could say, one of my closest friends started ignoring me in early 2011. I became really depressed, broke down in school non-stop. But I survived and I'm glad for it. It gets lonely now though. I've no real person to talk to... to tell stuff to, no people to give me advice. I can't really blame my rl friends because most of them don't go through what I go through. My parents argue everyday, or rather my mum just throws her temper around for no rhyme or reason. The pressure's on me. Because I'mthe oldest, I'm expected to get good grades, expected to do what I have to do... My grades suck, and I'm really confused as to what my heart really wants. To continue in JC or move to poly? Sometimes, it gets so bad that I feel like cutting. But then I'm too scared to do it, so it's alright. I feel like I've no purpose in life, no direction, I'm only living because I've to live. I know I'm really fortunate compared to some people out there, but the negative thoughts keep coming. No matter how hard I try to stay happy. And it's just hard when sometimes all you wanna be is a different person, live in a different world, and be able to do what you really want to do without being scared.  And it hurts whenever I see that friend helping others and not caring/not even aware of what is happening to the people who really care about him/her. I appear like a really cheery, happy girl in school... but deep down though some of my friends know how depressed I get, no one knows the extent of my depression or suicidal thoughts... They all think I'm better now. But I'm not. I'm still just as insecure, just as weary, just as tired and sick of the world around me. I'm not sure whether I'll be able to fully trust anyone again.

And all the other recreational drugs have insane side affects that none of you hippies seem to want to talk about, like lsd having a huge risk of having heart attacks or strokes etc. I'm writing this because I've seen a growing acceptance online of these substances which RUIN LIVES and a generally a cultural swing (at least on Reddit) of it being completely fine and everyone seems to fail to mention the potential side effects of these harmful substances.

The thing is that I don't really know what I hoing through. I have started very mild self harm, I slap myself sometimes for no reason really hard a lot of times in a day. I feel like I am doing so just to convince myself that I am depressed, I feel like I am doing so only because other people do it. I don't know why am I feeling or thinking so. I think that I am not actually going through emotional distress and I am just pretending to be depressed and anxious and I that I am intentionally overthinking, All of this makes me think that I am a terrible person who is just a dumbhead. I feel like I am intentionally making myself sad and anxious. I don't know if this is true or not for real but the voice in my head keeps saying that I am faking it all just to not study. This all is making me scared and tense. I just don't know what's happening or I cannot understand what I am thinking for real or feeling for real.

I'm a father of 2 little girls, I'm married, and I do all that I can to keep up the motivation to keep on scraping by. They are the reason I live. And yet I am here.  I've recently come to terms with the fact that I try so hard for no other reason than to try and find pride in anything that I do, in hopes that it will somehow bring back any sort of desire to keep on living. I feel bad for even putting my story out there, in fear of taking away from someone who is perhaps more deserving of any sympathy. I wouldn't, at all,  consider myself a decent human being. And I feel as though I'm a disappointment in all aspects. I can't give my girls the life they deserve. My parenting is shoddy at best. I don't treat my wife how I should. I'm significantly less successful than everyone around me.  I feel trapped. I'm not sure if this is a cry for help, or if I'm just hoping that venting will somehow help the issue. It seems almost pointless that I'm doing this, because I know that once I've posted this I'll go back to my daily routine without sharing this with anyone I know personally.  I secretly hope that I disappointment my wife and children to the point that they leave me, so that all I have to do is wait long enough for my grandparents to pass so that I won't feel bad for offing myself. I've already lost my mother and my sister, and one of my grandfathers in a 9 month period. Is that what started all of this? ... I wish any of this had a point discernible to myself.

There is nowhere else for me to put these feelings; nothing works and when I try to explain my situation to people I get no sympathy and no love, just a cocked eyebrow or a ""Jesus christ this bitch is crazy.""

727,"My best friend just got transferred. Hey, everybody. This is my first time posting in this subreddit and I'm not sure if it fits, but I'm gonna post it anyway. Hopefully someone replies. Also, English isn't my first language, so please bear with me. So, well. Reading the title may make you think this isn't a big deal. But read the complete post before thinking that.   I am an introvert and have very bad social skills. I was a loner in high school, and had no friends in school. I wanted to have friends, have that ""normalcy"" that comes from being a teenager. But none of that happened. I was an outcast because of my scary looks and my general bad social skills. Then, in 7th grade, I met my first ever friend. We'll call them Ray. Ray was exactly like me, had minimal social skills and was an introvert as well. But we instantly hit it off as we both played Minecraft on survival servers ( this was 2013 ). By talking to Ray and hanging over his house, I was able to improve my social skills slowly but surely, talking to his parents and him. I started making other friends, though not as close as I and Ray are.  In 11th grade, depression hit me. I don't know if it was caused by my countrys shitty education system, or further bullying, or cram school, or all of the above. But I do know that depression hit bad. However, Ray was there to help me through that.  He told me he did nothing, but I seriously cannot thank him enough for just being my friend during those times. This year has been the worst year of a lot of peoples lives, but the icing on the cake was that today Ray told me that his dad got transferred. I was already quite depressed but this put me down even more.  Even though I know we'll try, I know for a fact I'll never see him again. We're both going to different universities and are going to be trying to get into universities in different countries. I just feel sad and worse than ever before. I know we can still keep in touch, but we'll not be as close as we were before. I have effectively lost my only friend. I don't know if I'll have any friends from here on now.

Links to previous posts:  [\#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j8p2ya/posting_one_math_proof_a_day_and_explaining_why/), which has links to #2 and #1. Today's setup will be a bit different -- I'll walk you guys through a ruler-and-compass construction and explain why it works. We'll be doing the ruler-and-compass construction of an angle bisector. &amp;#x200B; We now show that line CD does, in fact, bisect angle ACB. To do this, we show that triangles ACD and BCD are congruent. By construction, we have that the length of segment AD is equal to the length of segment BD. We also have, by construction, that the length of segment AC is equal to the length of segment BC. As the two triangles share the side CD, they are congruent by side-side-side congruence. Thus angles ACD and BCD are equal, and hence CD is the bisector of angle ACB. QED. This proof is beautiful partly because of its age. Euclid invented this proof, thousands of years ago in Ancient Greece. It's stood the test of time and is still taught and used now. That's pretty damn cool. It's also beautiful because of its uses. By changing around the proof just a little bit, we can show that every point of an angle bisector is equidistant to the two lines that form the angle it bisects. We can also use this to construct a line perpendicular to another -- after all, that's just bisecting a straight line. From there, we get many more constructions -- Construction of parallel lines, construction of a square, and many more. All from that little proof.",0,suicide

I am not properly educated about stuff like fate but I feel like I was doomed from the start. Everything in my life is opposite of what I want. There are no exceptions. My name, my look, my height, my family, my friends, country that live…      Maybe my inabilty to adapt is my biggest issue, I don't like being grateful of what I have, If something can't make me happy why the fuck would I be grateful for it? Oh am I supposed to learn to be happy? I thought that was included. You can't learn to be happy in a bad spot, you're full of shit if you think you can. People with disabilities are the biggest example to this, everyone says ""look at those guys, they don't even have arms but they are happy, you have arms why are you not happy?"" People with severe mental disabilities or physical disabilities get special treatment, that's why they are happy. No one treats me different because I can't differentiate between blue and purple or because I am depressed.      Everything is wrong and I can't make it right.",1,suicide

(IN SELF DEFENSE) Around a half hour ago I went to the gas station to get some candy and stuff, and then after I payed I went to the preschool near it and sat on a bench and ate some candy. I went over to the trash bin to throw it away. Then this guy started talking to me, so I said ""Hi"" and he said hi back. I then went to the playground to go on the swings (hey it's fun) and the guy grabbed my shoulder and pulled me backwards, flipping onto my back. He grabbed my back and then stared yelling at me to give him my wallet. I don't have a wallet yet, and I had used all my money on candy at the gas station. He said he didn't believe me and he picked me up by my collar. I was scared, a LOT! But I knew what I had to do, I reached into my pocket and grabbed my knife, I stabbed him in the thigh with it.

I see the way that I act and think and I can't control it anymore. I can't stop the pain and the urge to hurt and kill myself. I can't control my reactions to things and the extreme emotion I feel. Sometimes I just want to scream and scream and scream. I feel like I'm a waste of space in society. I don't think there is any help for me anymore. I see the pain I cause my boyfriend, my friends, and my family. I barely speak to anyone anymore about how I feel. I can't trust anyone, I feel so alone. I feel like all the therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists don't know how to help me, that they blame me for being this way, for being a pathetic waste of space. Sometimes I just sit in my room and just slap and punch my face over and over until I bleed. I cut my wrist and bruise myself because I feel like I should punish myself for being such a horrible human being. Sometimes the only response to the pain I feel inside is just more physical pain. I can't control my actions anymore. Sometimes I want to jump out of the car whilst it's moving. Sometimes I want to jump in front of the train and I really have to stop myself from doing it. Sometimes I want to wake up at 2 am and just walk out into the cold and drown myself in the river. I want my body to float away to a place where nobody can find me.

776,I tried to kill myself the day before Halloween not sure if I was almost successful.I was never told if I was almost successful.  I just looked up nortriptyline hcl and it said an overdose could be fatal. I took 240mg which was 24 pills. 10mg each. They never told me I could have killed myself. I just was saying I can't tell if I'm having a really bad trip or if I was overdosing.  I started freaking out before I could finish the rest which was a total of 30 pills. So did I almost kill myself or was I just in for a bad trip? They didn't ever tell me. They had me drink Charcoal and put IVS in my arms. I was too doped to remember.  I realised what I was doing and I was crying the entire time I swallowed the pills while staring at my pet . The only real close relationship I have. I remember staring at him and he just stared at me back. Just with a curious look. I felt so bad that I was going to leave him. Leave him all alone. I took him in and promised to take care of him and I was just going to leave him. So I immediately told my roommate I think I need to go to the hospital.  At this point I already felt chills and couldn't stop shaking.  I was slurring a lot. Then I would feel fine just out of it when we were driving. Then when the car stopped moving I would feel the need to shake and slur again and it was really weird. I was put on suicide watch and was told I was involuntary hold because they didn't feel safe I went home. So I spent 2 days in the hospital and when I felt normal I asked to talk to them again. I didn't want to be sent away so I told them I would get help. I just didn't know where to go. So today I was released and I feel very confused. I have small headaches every now and then but that's it. I'm suppose to get a visit tomorrow.  This will be the first time I've actually reached out for my depression that I've had for a very long time. Hope it helps.,1,suicide

Ever since that time I have been at university and I have had a friend which has been there for me every since it started. She went to doctors appointments with me when I got diagnosed, came into my room whenever I was crying. She was very much like a sister to me. Helped me out a lot and we even washed each other's dishes and stuff for each other and made the same meals. She did snake me out a lot however by telling a flatmate who bullied me about my mental illness about all of the traumatic things I was going through and I was upset about this. We had a lot of arguments about this and then much bigger arguments about smaller stuff happened. I went too far one month ago and told her that she didn't care, that she wants me dead and even said I would record my suicide and send it to her. I was drunk which is no excuse and I would take back every word I said that night if I had the chance. She has blocked me on everything and can never speak to her.

803,"Questions about texting from an overthinker Might delete this post and might not reply to comments but just want to see if any of my general overthinking-isms are valid and want some validation for the logical side of my mind that says I'm overthinking. Here they are as follows: Does it come off as needy to start too many text conversations? I've been texting with this girl nearly every day during school and the weekends but our convos almost always start with something school-related and spiral into multiple hours long back and forth. Over winter break there is obviously nothing school-related to talk about so I've only come up with an exigence to start a convo once so far in what has been a 4 day-break. Despite that conversation going from Saturday morning into late in the night, do I come off as too needy of a friend if I were to start another convo too soon, should I wait a few more days before trying to come up with something to talk about? For some other info I'm pretty sure she texts with a decent few other people (maybe only a few and not a decent few, am not entirely sure) as well and I don't text with too many others. Also, is it a good or bad thing that she's said she tends to be kept up at night dwelling on things that she's said that she thought were awkward to other people (probably more figuratively being kept up at night but she still thinks about them) but that I don't seem to judgy so she doesn't really get any sort of anxiety or whatever from saying things she thinks are awkward around me? Also, I think she texts maybe a few other guys, am not sure how many or how frequently though if that adds anything more to the equation. &amp;#x200B; That was a lot of words and I think I may have slightly answered some of my questions in the fact that I was able to write so much about all of those questions but would appreciate some validation from internet strangers that I am in fact overthinking.

I don't know how to put it into words.. and if I'm not pretending to be them, I'm really thinking about them. You could even say obsessing. Everything I think involves them  Sometimes I have these long full conversations with myself.. as like, up to 6 different characters.

808,"Need advice- brother attempted SuicideI got news this morning that my brother intentionally crashed his car on the freeway this morning in a Suicide attempt. It seems that the injuries are minor, but he is still getting checked out. I think he has been admitted into the psych ward. I haven't been able to speak with him yet. I'm boarding a plane now to be with him this week. His girlfriend of 5 years broke up with him a year ago and he took it hard. Since then he had another 7 month relationship which he just chose to end- I know he felt guilty about it because she took it hard. He's also been dissatisfied at work because he does not make as much money as he would like. He had been planning to move to work/live closer to my brothers and I.   All that being said, I speak with him frequently and he seemed very stable and happy, but ready for a change. I would not have considered him depressed and NEVER would anticipate this. Just yesterday he was texting me normally and happily. He has many friends and is good at his job. I'm in relatively good health. I know he mentioned that he regrets that sometimes when he drinks with friends he goes ""overboard"" and gets more drunk than intended, but that did not seem to be a big issue in his life. I'm worried, but in a very rational place. My parents are completely distraught. Do you have any advice on what to say to him? Or to my parents? Like I said, I'm not expecting a miracle so no pressure.  How can I help him feel better and get better? Any common pitfalls that we need to avoid? Any good resources I should know about?

809,"Personal Vlog...So this past Saturday was 23 years I've been here alive. And on that day I broke down twice because no matter what variable I change nothing gets better, nothing really ever goes right, and no matter how much I beat the shit out of myself to become more successful I can never climb the next step as if something is pushing me back down. As much as I plan and plan and plan I can't manage money for anything. I get a decent bit saved something ALWAYS goes wrong and I have to use all of my saved money to make it better. Where did I or when did I lose the manual on life. Why cant I find the factory reset button on myself. Sometimes I sit and hope this is just a simulated reality like that video game in Rick &amp; Morty, or that I'm stuck in the matrix... that's just some of the little things I tell myself so that I can get minute relief. I smoke so much weed and I can't manage to get anywhere near as high as everyone around me does. I feel like I have no feelings towards anything. I'm insensitive I feel like... it's only gotten worse though since i made it to the top once and was happy in my life and then lost it all and I feel like now I am stuck at the bottom. I try to lift my head back up to get up on my feet and the force called ""life"" pushes me back down. Idk man. I try to open up to the people around me, but the things on my mind that bother me that I want to talk about cause more issues then good. When did I get cursed? Is the devil real and now I'm stuck because I'm now soulless.... I'm so confused about myself and I have no one to compare too that could help me. People tell me I'm great, but deep down I don't feel it. I feel like I give up myself to make sure others are in good hands... and where helping others like that would make most happy.. it just makes me feel like I'm actually missing out on something.

I've had diagnosed depression since 2012; this was triggered when my dad had too much to drink and we got in a physical fight (me being female and much smaller than him, it was not fun). I've been on antidepressants for the past 6 months, currently on 20mg of citalopram. Despite everyone telling me that it'll get better, every episode of depression seems to worsen. I become abusive to my friends, especially one in particular who has been very supportive. I cry constantly, switch from being happy to suicidal and back again in under an hour. My habits have become so bad that the only way I can think of to get attention is by telling people I feel like committing suicide. While this is true, I know it's highly manipulative, and makes me feel worse. My only coping mechanism for any negative emotions are thoughts of self-mutilation and suicide. I don't know what to do. I know that if I continue to act like this, I will drive away all my friends. (Pretty surprised they haven't told me to fuck off and die already.)

I have always been terrified of being put in a mental health hospital, so it shows how serious I am about getting help, the fact I applied to get put in I'm worried that I won't get better, and there is no getting better, I'm doing this because my friends are clearly either fed up or struggling or both, to be there for me, and without support I know I'll do it I've already thought about doing it if I'm not taken into the hospital, but that's if, a big if I can make it to the appointment, I'm struggling to stay sane, I had a meltdown over new years whilst my entire family(aunts/uncles, grandparents etc) were just a floor down I'm thinking about self harm a hell of a lot more than I ever have, and it's so scary Tldr I'm scared if I get help, I'm scared if I dont",1,suicide

He never wants to talk about it and every time I ask him he simply responds ""I'm fine"" and change the subject. Nothing I say seem to go through to him.  His behavior has changed so much over this past year, and I don't really know what to do. He has stopped working out, both going to the gym and track and field. He used to really love both, especially the latter. He would go to multiple competitions over each season and end up high on the scoreboard. Despite this, he stopped showing up for practice, right out of the blue. He'd have some reason like ""I have to make food today at home"" or ""I have too much schoolwork to do"".  He has also started drinking. Before last spring he had never been near alcohol, but suddenly he was out drinking 2-3 weekends a month. He also started smoking around the same time, ""joking"" that the only reason he did was because he was hoping to get cancer so it would kill him.  When he is not partying, the only thing he does is sit in front of his computer and play video games. The only reason he plays games though appears to simply be that it burns time until he can go to bed and repeat. He seems to have completely given up on school, spending less and less time on the assignments. He rarely touches anything to with school before the day of handing it in, and never reads up on the material before a test.  Whenever he hangs around me or other friends he always smiles and laughs, but it never seems to quite reach his eyes. He always has somewhat of a distance between himself and the group, preferring to be on his phone over talking with the rest.  He seems to have really bad memory, both short-term and long-term. You can ask him about anything game related, but that's about it. He has no grasp whatsoever about what we're currently doing in school, nor plans or appointments he has scheduled.

Here are some things I would like to say: I'll start with something that has been bothering me for a while: it really feels like the end of the world as we know it. And now, some other stuff: 1. Don't open something nsfw on reddit, unless you know exactly what subreddit you're on (learned that the hard way) 2. If you're having online classes, we all feel your pain. Also, this means you don't really see people in person anymore or have large social gatherings (yay for introverts)  3. It's very easy to just sit around in bed all day and do nothing. However, it is very nice to have a routine and healthy too. Take some online courses! Learn some new skills! Take up a hobby! 4. Don't do what I did - if you want to ask someone out, just do it. You're not going to see them anyway in person, so it'll be less awkward. 5. Take care of yourself. I can't stress this enough. Physical and mental health are really important. Take some time for yourselves and get some workouts done. Meditate if that helps, or at least try if you haven't. 6. As unimportant as it may seem, school has it's benefits, so don't skip classes. Your teachers will appreciate it even if you just attend the first few minutes of class and go. Lastly, remember that you are important, and you have the potential to be the most talented, most interesting and extraordinary person in the universe.

I was the happiest I had ever felt in my life. Then the last 2 weeks something changed. I don't know what but she suddenly became distant and I became frustrated. She was being completely unreasonable and would get so upset with me whenever I asked what was going on. Our daily hours of calls suddenly stopped and she would even reject my calls, which is completely unlike her.

This is my reason for giving up. If I go away now, she won't remember me and no harm will be done. Everyone hates me and I have no friends, why do you think I'm posting on Reddit. This is a very loud cry for help that people will hear and choose to ignore. That is also why I'm finally killing myself. The people I thought were friends turned out to be two faced. I mentioned one negative thing someone has done, (a girl kept calling herself ugly right after everyone told her she wasn't, I said that she was just wanting attention) everyone hates me now. I'm going to fucking blow my brains out. And literally no one will miss me. I know after they find out I died they'll say ""yeah I knew she had a mental illness, she shouldn't have had a baby"" while sitting next to the guy that left her when she was 13 weeks pregnant, then came back just to cheat on her again.

904,"Am I a lost cause ?Hi everyone, Sorry in advance for my English. I'm writing here today because I need to talk and here is why. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 4 years ago and I was in depression for around 2 years. It was awful. I wanted to die , life was disgusting and I had no interest for anything around me. I started to feel better after taking a lot of meds, seeing a psychiatrist and all that stuff. Once everything was behind me, I started to feel better. I found a way to progress in my life. I finally got accepted at the university and everything just got better.  Until these last 6 month, I think everything is coming back at me and no matter what. I don't sleep , I don't eat , I hate my life. To be more precise, I hate life. And now I just don't know what to do. I don't want to get down that path again but what is the point to see a doctor again if everything will just turn it to be the same again and again? What is the point to try to fit in this life and beeing happy while I just can't ?  Some day I feel okay and some I just picture myself throwing myself off a bridge. I am lost here. I see myself as a lost cause who will be unhappy forever. In the bottom of my heart I do want to be happy but I just can't... My head just won't let me.  I just don't know what to do anymore. Living is unbearable and dying is not an option either but I know that each day just make this option more appealing. Sorry for the long story but I needed to talk and here it is. Thanks",1,suicide

908,"The EndI don't want to make this dramatic - I've posted once before and thought I was getting better. Unfortunately I believe I was lying to myself more than anything else.  Life seems to refuse to get better for me despite my best efforts. I dated a girl for 4 months I thought I liked, but she used me for money. I starved practically to ""help"" her out and when she got all she needed out of me she cheated on me and then dumped me, on my 30th birthday, via the cell phone I paid for so she would have a contact number while applying for work. Unlimited text and calling I shit you not.  I met another girl later on and she used me for emotional comfort and when she was done told me she just wanted to be friends for now.  The point is I am being used and have a long, life-long history of it. I am a survivor of what I only willing to describe as slavery in another nation before I came here. My adopted parents here (I am an orphan with no knowledge of my extended family) used me to get kickbacks from the government - I was dressed horribly while my 2 brothers had every piece of shit trendy ass clothing you could think of. I don't care about the clothes but I do care about being cared for.  In my life I seem to literally be a tool. I am tired, sad, depressed, and don't want to go on anymore. Not like this. I still can't seem to make friends. The ones I do have don't listen or understand how I am in so much pain over all this. I have never, ever experienced real happiness and have a large ugly emotional scar on me for being used so horribly during the course of my life - from people who I thought were friends in school (until they didn't need me) to my so-called family, to women, to my boss who despite my severe ass busting won't promote me and likely someone else, to people who only act as though they like me until someone else shows up.  **TL;DR** I have been alone my whole life - I see no other choice or alternative to end the pain.

I had a job interview for a library technician position at a school which basically involved all the things I currently do, but during the pre-interview the hiring manager told me that I shouldn't get a job as a ""learning experience"" and suggested that I should spend a few years ""subbing"" as a library tech, which basically means doing the exact same job except without the pay, security, and benefits of a full-time position.

I had a few anxiety panics, I just lost control over myself. It started when I had a small insignificant fight with my brother. For some reason I just filled with rage I never knew I could feel. I punched the bathroom door and just left. Than I wandered around for a while feeling even angrier and just kicking and punching everything in my way, hurting myself in the process but still continuing. Than I started having suicidal thoughts which made me only more nervous than I was. I started having those episodes where if I think even for a microsecond of any problem I have in my life i start to loose control of my breathing, i start to cry uncontrollably, i fall on the floor and just feel really really bad, until it just passes. I take a few deep breaths and I look normal again. It started a few hours ago and I've had 8 or 9 of those already. I had suicidal thoughts in the past, but i never was close to actually killing myself. Today after feeling angry I went to the beach and stood on one of the cliffs contemplating suicide seriously, in the last second i decided i can't do this to my mom. When I got home I started researching suicide methods online and afterwards I took a 500mg acamol box which I wanted to mix with alcohol, at this point I'm not sure whether or not I wanted to kill myself, i was on semi auto-pilot. Eventually i took 4 tablets which I eventually vomited. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME?? WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME TODAY?? p.s I took the pills about an hour ago and I'm not feeling so good. Can the pills take effect even if i didn't digest them? Edit: Following AndCat's advice I went to the emergency room where they gave me a pill to come me down.

EVERY DAY. I'm done telling people and having a little bit of hope that they'll care, just to be let down every fucking time - again and again. No one means what they say, and no one will stay.

I feel horrible having exhausted my friend's goodwill of listening to me in the past. I know she isn't obligated to listen to me, but it's so painful to work uo the courage to tell someone only to be rejected. I've attempted suicide in the past and ended up in the hospital. I wrote my own suicide note a few days ago even. It's not really that i want to die, I'm just tired. I see people talking about wishing there was  third option and I really relate to that.

1030,"It‘s so depressing to know that you‘ll die in the future because you will take your own lifeHello. I just wanted to post my thoughts. I‘m 18 and i live in germany. I got diagnosed with depression and a personality disorder. I‘m in therapy but i don‘t feel any better. I seeked help because i don‘t want to live like this. I‘m crying every night because life is so painful to me. My mom died because of suicide too. She was a great mother. She got money and seemed happy. My dad abused her, cheated on her and took is away from our mom. At this point i didn‘t knew that life is going to be awful. My Dad tried to control my life and abused me. He was very violent. One day he kicked me out with 17 years because of my sexuality. I lived at my Friends house for a month or so. And then i had to go into the childrens shelter, where i tried to take my life by suffocating with a plasticbag but i stopped because i started to cry because i Don‘t want to hurt my brothers,my boyfriend and my aunt. After 3 Months i moved to my aunt. I was absolutely emotionally destroyed. Of course my aunt has stricter rules than my dad because she knows how life is. But i‘m not used to it. i‘m Already trying so hard to improve (especially for myself) but i can‘t. I‘m a looser. My Grades are bad, because i‘m so depressed everytime. I can‘t cope with life. I have a lot of xanax in my pocket for an emergency. I know that i‘ll be in a state of trance and depression someday that‘ll make me commit suicide. These Xanax pills hopefully will stop me from doing that. It‘s so depressing that my life will be over in the near future.

Mental health issues, for which I didn't have the energy to consult, made me fail everything and I'll be kicked out of school.  I see a lot of people who had not the same motivation nor ability as me succeeding and it makes me feel sad.  Not that they do it, but that I couldn't.  I can not get back in my domain nor in grad school in general after a failure.  That's how that shit full of pretentious ass holes work.  No humanity.  You do, or we assume you can't.  I could if I was healthy.  They will never understand that. I can't see myself doing anything else, I don't want to do anything else, I've lost basically all of my adult life to get there, only to be killed by mental illness after 7 years of hard work that now becomes useless.

For the past few weeks I've been debating with myself whether or not I should just end it. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but while in the past I would have pushed them away, now I'm welcoming the thought. I'm losing my will to live at an alarming rate. I don't think I'm meant to ever be truly happy in this world. My life sucks and is absolutely miserable right now and it might get even worse as the reality of being homeless is crawling closer and closer. I need to be realistic with myself. My life will never improve. I'll never have a career, I'll never have any tangible skills nor talents, I'll never have a decent social life, a girlfriend, my student loans will never go away, &amp; worst of all, I'll never get away from my crazy ass mother. Suicide is becoming more realistic as time goes on. Life is completely bullshit and is just way too fucking hard. Everyone tells me about how it's possible to turn your life around, but they fail to recognize the luck others have had in doing so which I lack. The one thing that's comforting about suicide is the idea that if things ever gets too bad, I can always use it as a last resort and stop the pain. I'm going to die die one day anyway so what's the difference if I do it early, especially considering I have no future anyway?",1,suicide

1043,"Ok which one of you is cumming in his sister's shampoo again? Check out this story, copypasted from relationship_advice So this is a bit of a long story, but a couple months ago, I (18F) noticed a couple streaks of white in the purple shampoo i was using, I didn't think much of it at the time but I didn't use it as I thought maybe my brother (16M) was using that bottle for something else, it was almost empty anyways. I got more shampoo, this time it was a white coconut shampoo, and was using it in my hair regularly until i noticed it had moved from the shelf in the shower to a different spot. It was about 3/4ths gone by then, and I'd bought 2 bottles so I began using a different bottle and keeping that in my bathroom drawer so no one touched it. As time went on, the shampoo bottle in the shower literally was slowly filling up almost halfway full, when i decided to mark it and watch how it filled. Within a week or so it was filled past the mark. I checked, it definitely wasn't water, and it fucking stank. I think he's been shaking the bottle up too, to mix it together. Nobody touches the soaps in our shared bathroom but me and him, and he has his own shampoo so there's no reason for him to touch mine. My only logical conclusion is that he's been masturbating into my coconut shampoo. Quite honestly this disgusts me and freaks me out and I don't know at all how to tell my parents or how to talk to him about it. I've developed a fear of using the soaps in our bathroom and I've been showering at my boyfriend's house every day. The shampoo bottle is still there it's almost full by now, does he think this is some sort of game? I'd like to understand why this is happening but I don't want to look like a fool if I don't have any proof. Sorry this is such a weird and gross situation but I really need help here.

1095,"I've seen how good it can be and find it hard to cope nowI'm 19 and have been suffering from depression since I was 14, got it officially diagnosed nearly a year ago when things got harder than ever, went to my college counselor, jumped through the hoops of therapy and antidepressants and trying to not let my family and friends know what's going on. I've given up on both therapy and the medication for a few reasons. One thing that has brought me joy throughout my life is my significant other who I met online four years ago. I recently got work for the summer, saved up and traveled 9,000km to visit him. I spent 10 days with him and it was everything I hoped it was, it felt like we'd be together for ever, I felt like someone actually cared about me for a change. Back here at home I have friends but I don't feel I connect well with them, I'm more friends out of proximity than anything else. They're all great people and I enjoy my time with them but I just don't think I mix well with them which leaves me feeling pretty alone in general even when I'm with them. Being gay and pretty unhappy about it means I've never had a relationship before this and I've never met anyone who I was interested in. Having spent those days with my S/O I didn't feel depressed or suicidal at all, it was genuinely the happiest I've ever been. Now I'm in a position where I won't be able to visit him for atleast a year. I'm in my final year of a pretty intensive, full time college course where I won't be finished until next September, I won't even be able to work next summer because my course will take up all of my time. I'm really upset about all this and I'm anxious that something might happen in all that time. Having experienced that happiness and knowing it's so far away again makes my depression even worse and it's been pushing me back into a place where it feels like giving up now instead of holding on is easier and might save me from anymore upset. It's given me something to work towards now which is great but I've trust issues, I've depression and I've still got all of my usual problems. It's getting harder and harder for me to want to hold on.",1,suicide

I feel a literal pressure on my body, that is crushing me. I stutter (which i usually dont) and mispronounce or i cant spell or i forget what i was saying. I am also depressed. It all started in primary school. There was my girl-friend that i knew since kindergarten. She had cancer and sadly died in 2nd grade. When i was in 2nd-3rd grade, 4-6 kids would bully me. They pushed me to the ground and called me names, only to laugh at me. My mother was an alcoholic and screamed at me all the time. She tried to commit suicide, but failed. She is now sober since november 2018. I havent felt happy in over a year, but i cant do anything about it. I have 2 friends, one doesnt care about me and the other constandly dumbs me and uses me. I cant make new friends because of my anxiety. I tried to tell my parents about me having sozial phobia and being depressed, but my i cant say anything because of my sozial phobia. I tried a kind of amphetamine, to supress my problems, but when the drug whore off they came back. Im also addicted to caffeine pills because im not motivated to do anything. Without them i would just lie in my bed 24/7. The things that used to bring me joy dont anymore. The last time i felt genuinely happy, was when i was on drugs. I hate my body i have diabetes (born with it), my feet are at a wrong angle and i have bad eyesight. I was also overweight. I already had suicidal thoughts 2 years ago.

In a way it's almost worse when people do care, because then you hear bullshit like, ""Just be cheerful!"" or ""You're as happy as you decide to be!"" Like people choose to be depressed. They think it's just some switch you can flip on or off, and they're ignorant of how hard you're actually trying. ""Hey, I didn't lay in bed all day hating myself, can you give me some credit?""

Every time something stabilizes is when a rugpull is about to happen. It gets ready for war, while we're at peace with it. Life shows no mercy. No one ever ""gives up"" yet everyone always loses. Staying alive forever is an even worse scenario. We just can't win.  There is no meaning to our suffering or to anything. No one ever witnessed any real proof that we're meant to be everything or nothing at all. Life is not real, is just a theory created by ourselves to pretend that we're somewhere while we are nowhere to be found. It's science fiction. No one likes life. It's just a terrifying downward spiral for everyone. Suicide is an escape and a shortcut to the background world beyond the forth wall. We can choose to die and end this right here and now.

1252,"Divine Comedy vs.Tragic Irony (Suicide Note)As I consider the methods by which I can end my life, I can't help but think about how your father ended his. My plan is similar but much less grisly; it is also ironic. When I was optimistic about my future, I took meticulous care of my car. For example, if its check engine light came on, I would either immediately repair it myself or, in cases that required extensive labor, have it repaired by a mechanic. Having failed to launch a career since I was in college, I no longer repair my car when that light comes on. As a matter of fact, my check engine light has been on for two years now, because its exhaust system is no longer efficient. That is, it is no longer efficiently reducing the amount of carbon monoxide the engine is producing. Whereas your father violently took his own life in the family van, I'm too much of a coward to end mine that way. Instead, I plan on using the carbon monoxide my car is producing to slowly, painlessly asphyxiate myself. To make the act easier to carry out, I'll probably park somewhere quiet, drink a case of my favorite beer, and then just get on with it. Here's the tragic irony: Had my life turned out better, I could have afforded a new car or would have simply fixed it myself. Now, however, it is poised to be the death of me. Don't worry. I don't have a spot picked out yet, but I'm working on it. ",1,suicide

I couldn't take seeing how she's completely flipped on me anymore. The lies and false promises she made about us, how she doesn't care about me anymore, seeing myself get replaced. I just can't do it anymore. I even got a puppy to help but that was a mistake since I also got it since she told me before seeing me with one would make her happy since we always talked about getting one together so I got it with this deep chance it'll fix things but it didn't. I love my pup but I feel I can't connect with him as I should because of him reminding me of her and also mainly distracting me in my ways I'm trying to cope. Apparently she told my roommate she has an email she's too scared to send me but I feel there won't be anything good in there anyway otherwise she would of sent it by now. I hate myself for this whole situation. I don't even wanna try bothering to love again since I feel it'll always go back to this somehow and I don't think I can survive another loss like this. I just wanna feel normal again. I want my life back. Even though my life was shitty and I was still really depressed, at least I wasn't grieving the loss of her as well.",1,suicide

They want to go to a club afterwards - I feel very uncomfortable to tag along, even though it's all part of the plan. It's a very popular club, which means prices are high and the people there are pretty snobby and elitist. No room for dancing and people are furious if you just slightly touch them by accident.

Meanwhile, I'm supposed to go there while looking like an abomination from a horror movie and that's with putting effort into my looks. They are disgusted by the sheer sight of my hideous body, without even having talked to me (and I'm sure that would only make things worse). The problem is, I promised somebody they could crash at my place and my flat ""mates"" are very uptight so it's either I go with them or they won't get into the apartment.

1341,"I just don't want to be judged.I am suicidal, I know that. I struggle to express myself with words. It drives me insane, it has also driven away the only person I've have loved and loved me back. I apologize but the next few paragraphs will read like they were written by a mad man (because they were). The breakdown of my relationship is going to ruin me. It's all my fault that she hates me. I treated her badly, by being the way that I am. I promised so much but didn't deliver. It makes me so angry at myself that I wasted her time. She is a wonderful person who deserves better than me. I was emotionally abusive, confiding in her about how I saw myself. Then putting myself on the line when she couldn't handle it, just to make her stay. I'm sorry I did this to you. I still love you, but I know it wasn't enough. Even writing this down to a bunch of strangers on the internet feels embarrassing. None of you know me or will ever find out who I am, but I still have that feeling of being judged, which I will take very personally. Even from internet strangers. This isn't a plea for attention, or even a plea for help. I don't really know what this is. Maybe it is my last entry into the internet. Who knows? I don't feel like committing suicide now. But the urged are getting so much more intense, they are becoming more real. Ive sought help in the past, but it wasn't for me. I struggle to be honest with myself, I know these facts about myself, that I do have very real issues. But I ignore them, I refuse to confront myself, I prefer to take the route of hiding and distracting myself till the feelings go away. Telling myself I'm making this up for attention. I'm caught in a loop, I know there are resources out there for me. But I don't want anyone to know that I am the way I am. For anyone who read this I apologize for dragging you into my mess.

It mainly all started when she posted on her snapchat story that her mom can't support her and her brother. I felt bad and was talking to her about it. We usually say ""goodnight :) &lt;3"" or something like that when we go to bed, but then she stopped doing that with me. I kept talking to her and then yesterday I asked how she was feeling. She basically told me she liked her friend. (she's bi) and I met her friend before, and well  I was at school and I was being a big baby. I was trying to hold back the tears but I just had to go to the bathroom to let them out. She kept saying please don't cry, and I just couldn't stop. She told me she didn't like me like that anymore but hopefully we can still be friends. I want her to be happy, but I mean I'm not. I liked this girl more than any other girl, which sucked. Whenever I see her name i picture her beautiful face and I just feel like crying. Today she hasn't opened any snaps, and didn't respond when I just said ""goodnight"" last night. She left me on open.

Right now I don't really have a lot of reason to get up in the morning. I just graduated this past May, and cannot find a job. As a result, I've had to move in with my parents. For a while, the best part of my life, and the only thing that made me happy was a girl I foolishly fell in love with. It was foolish because she's engaged, and I continued to fool myself into believing something could happen. I finally slowly realized that it was impossible. Anymore, all I want to do is sleep. I try to get out during the day, but it doesn't seem to help, so I often stay in. The thing is, people tell me my life will get better, but right now it's really hard for me to believe, and I find myself with less and less hope everyday. I tend to perform poorly in social situations, and find myself to be frustrated, miserable, and left out. Because of that, I've started to avoid being social, which isn't a whole lot better. I look at my life and I realize that I don't have much to look forward to, and I just wish more and more that I weren't so afraid of dying so that I could maybe accept that I need to go.",1,suicide

So I started crying because when people raise their voice at me even a little it makes me cry because I feel like I'm in trouble and then she said I wasn't allowed to go to Rose's house and that just made me mad and when I'm mad I lash out on myself and say to myself that if I was dead then nobody would ever need to waste time on me and then I get really sad and wish I was never born and wish that I could just go to sleep and never wake up. I feel like everybody hates me and I just don't know. All I want is to go to Rose's house. I don't care if mama takes away my phone or anything I just want to go to ros'shouse I'll do anything!

In a span of three months, both of my grandfathers passed away, and as a result of that, my mother took herself and my two siblings to our home country. Of course, it was a mutual decision, leaving myself and my father behind. We thought that they would be back in a month or two. Unfortunately, they were gone for half the year, arriving back in May of 2016. Those five months were the hardest of my life.  I thought everything was back to normal. Our family was together again. We were happy. For a short period of time. My mother and father argued constantly for the rest of 2016, with a few ""honeymoon"" periods in between. I didn't understand. If they were still sleeping together, why did they have head-to-head screaming matches? Things only got worse when my grandmother from my father's side came to visit. My mother is not a fan of my father's side of the family, and naturally, she was cold to my grandmother. I didn't care, it was your classic in-law feud.  Everything started to go downhill from there.

1427,"I'm a complete failure.For the past 4 years I've been working toward a computer science degree in college. Last fall I failed one of my major classes and the deal was that I would have to retake it with at least a B- if I want to stay in the major. This quarter I've been retaking that class, and again it's been really really tough. The final is this Monday, but the professor offered a large extra credit opportunity that was due yesterday. Whether or not I get a B- and stay in the major pretty much rests on this extra credit project. Turns out that the project is almost impossible. I tried working on it with classmates, but my classmates gave up. I tried paying over $100 for a few hours of guided programming time with a tutor, but he couldn't completely get it himself either. The deadline just passed and I was able to turn in a functioning project, but one that mostly does not fit the project requirements. I do not expect to receive much credit for my attempt. Thus, I will most likely be kicked out of my major. Here's what makes it even more awful: I was very very close to graduating. So close that my family is coming to see me walk at the graduation ceremonies next week and finish up a few credits in the Fall. They made travel arrangements a year in advance and they've been looking forward to it for so long. I'm absolutely terrified of how they would react to me failing out of a degree about my lifelong passion, especially considering my parents have paid for my entire tuition and most of my living expenses. I'm also terrified of how this is going to affect my career. I have an internship at a hugely well-known company lined up for this summer, but after that I don't know what's next. Sure, I can spend another year in school and still graduate with a general science BS and ""almost a computer science BS"", but that's obviously not the same to employers. I won't be able to compete with my classmates in the job market even though I'm just as qualified, if not moreso thanks to this internship. I don't know what to do. I'm lost. I'm scared.

I told her to go fuck herself when she was at the funeral of someone that she loved very much and stopped talking with her for six days instead of giving her support.

I feel like I'm fighting a pointless battle, and that any victory is Pyrrhic as best. I'm so sick and tired of not being good enough; of coming so close only to fail, of being so damn useless and feeling so damn powerless. relationships are few and far between, and they never work out. I've been unemployed for the last year, and my last job was a part time seasonal gig that interrupted an eighteen month stint of nothing.  I'm 22 years old. I should be a Fucking college senior or looking at picking up sergeant, not being a fucking loser who lives off the charity of friends and family. I have nothing left to lose, but I'm not really gaining any ground either. I'm a burden to those around me, barely pulling my own weight. the lowest common denominator in our problems is ourselves. I've done everything I really know how to do, and I've gotten nowhere, so why not just remove myself from the equation and make this easier for everybody? yes, I'd be letting the bad guys in my life win, but this isn't a fucking storybook, this is real life where the bad guys win all the time. what's one more casualty among the masses? I'm so tired of fighting, so tired of Coming so close, only to lose it all. What's the point? if suicide is murder, then I've certainly got means, motive and opportunity.

But I accidentally saw something concerning a few weeks ago about not knowing how longer she could go on, and I check back today and it's a story about how she wants to die more and more as time goes on. I've known she gets depressed, I do too..and I honestly live for her, because I was at a place in my life where I didn't care to exist any more. She said in that post that she knows people love her, and that she has a great job and pets, friends, and a boyfriend (me), she loves all of them..but she still wanted to stop in traffic while crossing the street. It said she knows I'll get tired of her at some point even though I've told her I can handle anything for her..and I have told her that. It ended with ""something will happen soon"" and I really don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to make things worse but if i do nothing and something awful happens..if she dies i know it will cost two lives. My life isn't the point here though. I need to find a way to help her. I'm sure a lot of you have been depressed at some point or another so you know that someone saying their there for you doesn't help a lot of times. And I know even when she's feeling awful she won't wake me up if I'm asleep because she doesn't want to worry or bother me even though I've asked her to. I'm really terrified at this point.

I have to do something about it, to end this now. I was never deserving to be here in the first place. For my loved ones, they'll understand when I'm gone. Loss is never easy to cope with and the last goodbyes will never be enough, but I can no longer stay here for other people. As much as I love them more than anything. I can't, it's tormenting me. I long for the peace and happiness and unconditional love I never had or will ever have on earth. I wish I got to experience that during my time on here but I was never meant to. I'm wired to not survive ever since I was born, thats how it should be. There's so much to write more, but I cannot possibly express in words what I'm going through or the pain I'm in.

1469,"My views are wrong so please correct me Earlier today I had posted something very unsavoury in the heat of anger and I had realised that it was a wrong thing for me to do. I will just rephrase what I had written there, and please just correct me where my ideals are wrong. I strongly condemn the act of rape and harassment, and the fact that rape and toxic male behaviour has suddenly become so widespread is a matter of concern for everyone. But i feel that the common method of 'rip and tear them until they are no more' is highly ineffective. I feel that we must view this as a social and a psychological problem alongwith criminal behaviour. It is my personal belief that very few people vecome evil on their own and most toxic behaviour can be traced back to social and environmental conditions. I had assumed that toxic male behaviour is due to three factors - a mainstream media strongly hostile to men, poor peer interactions which lead to alienation with females, and a male environment which emphasizes masculinity with how you treat females - particularly sexual activity. I had proposed a solution that women humanise themselves to men, they show that they are just as good and bad as men are. This way men would feel more open to interacting with them and toxic behaviour would be greatly reduced. One thing I forgot to mention in my previous post is to improve positivity among male-male conversations and to reform the definition of masculinity along the lines of feminist reform. If I am wrong please tell me where I am wrong and how am I wrong. Please dont start witchhunting me. I cried for an hour straight and called myself the biggest scum in the universe.

1482,"I'm unloved, unemployed and will probably be homeless in two weeks. Give me a reason why it isn't a good ideaThings haven't gotten better, even after more than a year of absolute agony. Every five years on average I feel insanely depressed, sometimes for a few years at a time. Even when I don't feel this horrible I never feel happiness or love: I just seem to remember less occasions of extreme abuse growing up. I don't even know which issue to start with first because there are so many things I need help fixing. I have abandonment issues because my mum couldn't be around to raise me between the ages of six months and three years and had to get passed around between relatives. After my mum completed her chemotherapy she came back but my dad was an absolute cunt of a person. He drank a lot, used drugs, was abusive and I think he may have sexually assaulted me. He also slept with other women and had a mistress and her kid living in the house with us. After getting out of that shitty situation and living in a women's refuge for a few months my mum became abusive too. She was no where near as bad but it didn't help adjusting to living without both parents at the age of five. I also got bullied at school because I acted out. So pretty much my entire life is escaping one shit place and landing directly in another. At the moment I live with a woman who's horrible to live with. She lies about everything, locks me in my room so she can fuck her boyfriend while I deal with neighbours complaining about noise, told me her friend was staying for a week and he's been here for nearly three and abuses drugs. I also very likely have a gambling problem and probably fit most of the criteria for alcoholism. Why shouldn't I kill myself? There is no light at the end of this tunnel, and every other time I have seen light there was a hole in the roof and for just a fleeting moment I could see the sky.

1511,"""Stop saying fat is beautiful"" is a stupid phrase. Here's why: (I commented something similar to this on someones post but it needs to be said here too.)  Unless you're a dietitian or nutritionist you have no right to comment on people's weights.  Some people are struggling with eating disorders.  Some people have medical conditions that affect their weight.  Some people start a new medication and they gain more weight. A ""skinny"" person could be super unhealthy because they eat McDonald's everyday. And an ""overweight"" person could be really healthy, eating balanced meals and exercising and taking vitamins and such. Unless you're a medical professional, shut up about people's bodies.  All you're doing is harming innocent people's self esteems. Also, each body is different and what might be ""overweight"" to some might be ""the healthy size"" for others. Weight doesn't equate to beauty. Beauty is also very subjective.  You're idea of beautiful is not universal and you shouldn't expect other people to alter their bodies to fit your ""type"". You've accomplished nothing by shaming someone for being fat, because fat shaming doesn't work.  It doesn't cure obesity.  It just crushes people's hearts. Shut up. It costs ZERO dollars not to talk about the way other people look.  And if you care THAT MUCH, go to nursing school. Become a dietitian.  Get a degree in nutrition.

I'm supposed to start a new job on Monday, but i don't think i'll make it that long. I have 3 people dear to me. 2 of them are men, both of them are great friends, and the third was the girl who I thought i would make my wife. She let me know tonight that there's a snowballs chance in hell that's going to happen. The thought of me starting a family with her was the ONLY FUCKING THING that kept me going. I no longer have that. I'm just so fucking lost and don't know what to do. I'm sick of this pain. SICK OF IT. I don't want to cause the few who care about me pain, but I don't think i can fucking take any more myself........ After the shit i've seen and done in the military, i just fucking cant. I guess i'm asking for help... No... Begging..... I wish i had more options, but after so many years, those have been exhausted, and I just don't see the light anymore. ",1,suicide

1521,"You know the song ""My Favorite Things"" from the Sound of Music? The lyrics say, ""When the dog bites, when the bees sting, when I'm feeling sad, I simply remember my favorite things and then I don't feel so bad."" But what exactly do you do when your favorite things remind you of a former partner because you shared every part of those things with them for so long? Or when your favorite ""thing"" (person) was your partner? I recently parted with someone (around 2 months ago) who meant the world to me. I shared every inch of my current life with this person for over 2 years. Even though I know the break up was for the best because it became emotionally abusive and some of my friends begged me to leave because of how it was affecting me, it still affected me to the point where I've been really depressed and unable to sleep. With the pandemic and my illness trapping me away, I can't really move on to better things... Everything I do has my partner carved in the memories. They even taught me my current favorite hobby. I can't sleep, I can't stop crying randomly throughout the day, and I can't focus on other things because other things remind me of them. I'm constantly reminded of the good, the bad, and the worst of the relationship. On top of that, I feel guilty for missing them and wanting them back when it was an emotionally abusive relationship. I shouldn't want them back, but I do... I don't know why my mind and heart are still holding onto them. My depression over this has gotten worse during the holidays. I feel like I'm stuck in a really dark place and I don't know what I'll do if I stay here... I just want out.",0,suicide

1529,"Can't stop thinking about suicide. The dread of waking up in the morning is becoming too much.Little bit of info about me, 19M my childhood was lovely till the age of 11 when I moved to a foreign country with my family. Ever since then my life has been nothing but solitude, disappointment and humiliation. I sucked at school and could never focus as the only thing I wanted to do was join the military, I always wanted to be a soldier and I  thought I'd love it.  I joined up last year and it has just turned out to be a nightmare. I'm terrible at soldiering and I don't enjoy it at all, I am still so alone every minute of the day and I can't take this prison-esque feeling any more.  My original role in the army was as a dog handler, my dream role I thought. Turned out I was terrible at that too. I ended up scraping through trade training but I decided to transfer as it wasn't for me and I didn't enjoy it like I thought I would. I'm now in a different job as a trainee again, so back to being treated like an infantile turd rather than an adult turd. I start my course soon but I'm pretty sure it'll turn out like everything else, and I'm stuck on this god awful camp for a year before I can get posted. The only twinkle of hope I have left is going for airborne squadron as I like PT, but I'm pretty sure I'll fail, I'm not great at it and my hatred for soldiering won't exactly work in my favour. That hope has dwindled very quickly. I only have my parents and sister, they are amazing. They are all I have, and I miss them every minute of every day. When I was driving back to camp yesterday I wished that a car would spin out of control, hit me and kill me instantly. That's how much of a coward I am, trying to dodge the blame so at least I wouldn't go with my family furious at me for causing them such pain. I feel I need help, I don't know where to go or what to do. I can't take the silence of loneliness any more. I just want to be content with life again, like I was as a kid.",1,suicide

I am 24-year-old introvert guy, who has emigrated to Australia recently. I am kinda introvert and have some can be considered as close friends. I have gone through a lot of things, including working in many underpaid jobs just to support my life here and finally got my permanent residency. I was so proud of that, even more when i got a job as accountant in a small accounting firm. However like they said ""the higher you climb, the harder you fall"", when i lost my job recently since my company was undergoing some major changes in their structure and there would be no more work that i could do, i am feeling so depressed and can't help the thought of being incompetent to keep the job. I've been trying to apply for another jobs but receive just rejection letters so far. Today it is even worse when my manager in my current underpaid part time job (where i've been working for nearly 3 years) said she was pissed when seeing me working so slow and wanted to fire me but would give me another two weeks to see how i would do. It was a huge shock since I didn't know what was just going on. My career is just in no where and even a underpaid labour job that I couldn't keep. I don't know how incompetent i can be.

I found out about after a month she already has a bf so we both tried to keep it friendly and I tried no to advance anything. There were times though in the middle of the night while we were talking I'd bring up how much I loved talking to her and that she turned out to be the perfect girl for me but already found someone. She often talks about the relationship she is currently in and it's never postive things. She said she wishes that she waited to get into a relationship because now she is unhappy. Yesterday she hit me with ""Can I be honest with you?"" to which I said of course. Apparently she made a post asking for advice because she's starting to have feelings for me but feels guilty since she has a bf.

1577,"Just alienated the last person that can help me step back. When all that's left are strangers...I just.... I can't take it anymore. I've felt like shit ever since my fiancee died, and it's coming up on 6 years (holy fuck 6 years, I didn't think it would be this.... fast) and I havn't had a serious relationship since. A close friend of mine had a bad scare with suicide (cops found her passed out in her car, stopped against the side of a building) and I decided to toss everything aside to help her with it. Moved 1k miles away from EVERYONE I know. And now.... she won't talk to me anymore. That's not the problem though. It's just.... my friends have abandoned me. I've got two great friends now, one male and one female (that I fell head over heels for, to the point where it became a joke with everyone). Drew, the guy, came and visited for a week, under the pretense of helping me out. Spent the entire week chasing ass. As far as watching craigslist to see when someone would post. Bailey, the female friend, has since started dating someone that tortured me through high school. Not just made fun of me, but absolutely tortured me through high school. And all I hear from them is how great this guy is. After telling her everything that happened.... it's all ""He's so amazing, he makes me feel like I am the only person in his life"".  It's gotten so bad that I can't work. I can't sleep. I was up for 5 days straight before I passed out on the phone with a customer. Not nodden off, but passed out. I woke up when I hit the floor. They sent me to the doctor... and he gave me a script for Xanax. I'm now looking at 40mg of Xanax and a bottle of grey goose.... and they start to look so good. The more I have them here, the better the idea seems. To just nod off..... let the pain go away.... and be done with it. and be back with my fiancee. The wife I should have had before she got taken from me.",1,suicide

Yes, even if they're the scum of the earth. Yes, even if you've had a rough day. Yes, even if you're stressed, tired, or upset with them. Because they're human too. Because they've had a rough day. Because everyone makes mistakes. Because everyone has a history. Because everyone was raised to have a core value or two. And they might be different from yours. And that's ok. Because they were raised differently, so of course they have a different perspective. Because they have had different experiences from you. Because no two people are the same, and it would be boring if everyone was the same. It would be great if we could frolic around on clouds made of cotton candy and never be more sad than someone who's had too many antidepressants, and never have to hear anything bad or experience anything that will make us suffer. But we can't, because actions have consequences, and cotton candy is surprisingly sticky and dissolves at a hint of rain, and overdosing on antidepressants can kill you, and we have problems that need to be spoken about before they can be fixed.

1592,"I wish I just died in that car accident.I had just finished college and bought my first car last June. It cost all of my money. It was a great car for its price and could have lasted me years. I was in a minor accident a mere two weeks after getting it, but it was only €50 worth of damage so I got off easy. I got a job working minimum wage in a call center for insurance the same month. Its an ok job but the money is mere peanuts for the labor of having to listen to people shout at me all day. I'm currently back living with my parents after college in a rural village and don't have many friends. All of them are either living back in Galway where I went to college or have moved to England or Canada. My life is basically get up, go to work, go home, spend the rest of my day on my laptop, sleep. A pretty dull life but my plan was to build up money, get my own place and find a good job with my software degree down in Dublin. However since last month, thinks started to take a turn for the worst. I was told I may not pass probation and will be let go by December because of my call quality. My alcoholic brother tried to choke me to death and I refuse to speak to him anymore. And to top it all off, I totaled my new car yesterday after skidding on black ice and rolled down a hill into a farmers field, destroying his gate and fencing. I came out unharmed but felt like a total idiot as I downright refused to learn my lesson about speeding last time. Now I have no car, the one thing I had, barely any money to buy a new one, have to pay for the damage to the farmers property, and I am in the process of losing my crappy job should I not pass probation. I am literally going nowhere in life. I feel it has no purpose. I barely speak to my friends, only my parents. My mother (despite good intentions) treats me like a child and my father always just berates me on what I should and shouldn't do. I just wish I died in that car accident and stopped being a burden to both them and the world.",1,suicide

I'm constantly overwhelmed with the idea that all of this is meaningless and there is no point to continue on. My death wouldn't mean anything anyways. It would carry no significance in the world. Sure my family and close friends would be saddened but they would adapt and carry on. There are so many problems in the world today. So much pain and strife all over the planet. It all just feels so hopeless and the more I realize how much darkness there is the more I want to just end this for myself. I've been struggling with depression for the last six years of my life and every time I think I'm getting better it comes back twice as bad as it was before. Honestly, if I wasn't so terrified of dying I probably wouldn't be here right now. But I don't know if that defense will hold strong forever.  I can say with certainty that I won't be ending my life today or anytime in the near future, but my mind is just in a really dark place right now.

(Scroll down to get straight to the point, I'll now be telling some backstory which also doubles as a rant) Today I went to Amsterdam with a friend of mine, eventually, as we both headed home and had split our ways I decided to get and eat a slice of pizza before biking home, which is a good 45 mins worth of cycling. Because I'm not that familiar with Amsterdam I wanted to be sure I was headed the right way.  I parked my bike next to me and sat down on a picnic table, as I was getting ready to open my maps app I looked up, and it seemed like this dude was in front of me out of nowhere.  He politely asked ''Ma'am, may I ask a question?"" out of mutual respect I removed my headphones (Still holding onto my phone with my other hand)  The bastard then reaches his arms out to grab my phone, I was able to get a better grip for a while, but to no avail. His bastard friend said something hesitantly, but the main thief did not listen, instead, I had to look the fucker in the eyes as he overpowered me and took my phone away. I swear, his stare seemed gnarly, I'd never seen one like that, ever. As if I was face to face with a husk. Before I knew it they ran off and turned the corner.  What just happened? 2 humans ((?) -were they though?) yoinked my phone and ran off within a span of 45 seconds. I was in complete shock, it all just passed so quickly and those fuckwits now gained extra cash, which quite frankly is absolutely disgusting. They really do not deserve a single fuckin' penny. I do however know what their address might be since they turned on my phone. We told the police, and they said there's nothing they could do. (stop scrolling!) ANYWAY, THE POINT I AM TRYING TO MAKE: Whenever a stranger walks up to you, ALWAYS make sure to put your valuables away first, or at least out of their reach.

I tried to change that behavior. I did change that behavior.    One of the disagreements with him was in that goddamn game. He started mocking me which first I didn't really care about.

When I was 11 I tried to kill myself for the first time, ended up in hospital. From then until November last year I attempted suicide four times. My body is covered in scars.  Mid last year I stupidly decided to buy some heroin online and subsequently became an addict. Yes it made me feel 'better' but I stopped eating, stopped going to work, basically stopped doing anything except shooting up and nodding out. It all came to a head on the 9th November last year when I attempted suicide for the last time. I filmed a video and sent it to my ex-boyfriend at 4am, then took a wide variety of prescription and illegal drugs, shot up the last of my heroin and laid down in my bed to die.  Luckily, my ex had got up early that day for work, had uncharacteristically read his emails and drove like a madman the 20km to my house and saved my life. I don't remember much of the following couple of days but I woke up in hospital. After that I promised to stop using but I lied. My ex took me back and I pretended to be happy but really I was still planning to kill myself, and I was definite about finishing the job properly this time.  But then I got committed and finally got the help I had needed for almost 20 years - ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). I've had 12 sessions of ECT and I can honestly say I no longer want to die. I can honestly say I am happy and hopeful for the future. I haven't even had ANY therapy, group or singular - I'll be starting singular therapy next week and will be having maintenance ECT starting in the new year.

I got my concussion at the end of junior year and it all went down hill. My grades dropped (4.0 weighted 2 quarters straight), I isolated myself from some of my more athletic friend, and I was told by my parents and sports med doctor that I really should think long and hard about ever playing sports again. I thought long and hard, and decided to try to start running before deciding. Bad idea. I collapsed from dizziness every time. I quit lacrosse. I quit soccer. I quit basketball. Started running everyday. First just down the street, slowly increasing my distance. I still got headaches. Grades were still bad. Still can't concentrate. I went to a neurologist and she gave me a steroids to stop headaches. I hasn't worked, just made me sick.  I now have slight anger problems that scare some old friends away. I'm disrespectful to people. I know its a bad thing but I can't help it. It just happens. I can't concentrate on anything. And I don't know when it started, if it was right after the concussion or right after I had to quit sports but I keep feeling like my life is honestly pointless now. I have short term memory problems, I'm in constant trouble with my parents, my grades keep dropping, I'm no longer the superstar athlete  used to be. I know I'm young but I don't know why this came back. I can't tell my parents. My dad thinks that I'm still faking my headaches and my mom doesn't believe in mental illnesses. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. ",1,suicide

I know it's kind of a standard thing for many college kids, but the fact that this is a shared experience doesn't really change things for me. I hate college, but I know if leave I will feel even shittier doing nothing with my life. I come from a broken home, and we've been financially struggling since my parents got divorced. I've gone to therapy, started lexapro, I exercise daily, yet I hate life. I feel hopeless. I know it's supposed to get worse before it gets better, but I don't care. I don't abide by any religions, so I don't know if I believe god can save me from this sadness. I don't expect life to get better either. Everyone in my family has mental issues that they will probably never get help for. My anxieties and depressive thoughts feel inescapable. I don't know what happiness is anymore. I know I'm young, and there is so much time ahead of me, but that thought is almost dreadful to me because I know I'll waste that time somehow. There is so much pressure on me to succeed in our family, and I'm scared I won't. I'm scared I won't find a job after graduation, I'm scared I won't find love. I'm scared I won't have any friends left because they all found better people. I have an amazing support system right now, but it all feels so deeply rooted in my biology and who I am.

1774,"Just gonna rambleI never felt suicidal until the summer of 2015. After I was sexually assaulted I was convinced I had HIV (I had mono three weeks later which mimics the symptoms of seroconversion exactly). I hated myself for putting myself in a position that could wreck my life. I quit seeing my family and going to train martial arts because I was scared I would accidentally infect someone (you're most infectious the first 6 weeks). After looking up the cost and terrible side affects of the HIV meds, I realized I could never burden someone with a relationship if I was positive. So I broke it off with the guy I was falling for and decided if I was positive suicude was the only option. This horrified me because I loved being alive and my self hatred reached new levels, since I blamed myself for what happened.  I cried all day every day for weeks alone. I tried going to a few clinics for help but they were only interested in helping homosexuals psychologically. I was too afraid and ashamed to report the assault for many reasons so I didn't get help. After I finally tested definitely negative I thought I would feel relieved and grateful. But nothing got better. Ive been alone and unable to function since. A lot of really horrible things also happened to me in mental hospitals and stuff. I lost my dog and the abusive guy I dated stole over 10k from me. At some point I fixated on suicide again. The constant fear of death was gone and the PTSD lifted. I stopped having panic attacks and nightmares. But if I start feeling a desire to live again, I am overwhelmed with grief, terror and grief at everything I have lost and how evil some people are. I feel like if I ever found a smidgen of happiness it will be taken from me or used against me. The person I was a year ago gone. I'm not a person anymore. I've been dead for a very long time already.",1,suicide

I knew my potential was unlimited, that it was a lack of... of something, I don't know what, that condemned me to this rut I'm still in. Not some inherent, unfixable defect. Now it's lethargy. Why do I even bother, when I have failed so many times? What's different? These are the unwelcome thoughts always lurking in my brain. I was broken; I just had to put myself back together. Now I feel whole, but useless; a cruel joke, filler for the people who actually do stuff that matters.  I want that faith back. That anyone is capable of anything if they just try hard enough. Chronic failure and exposure to a world that's even worse than I had imagined it to be has stripped that from me. I'm not beyond saving yet; I still believe that to be a valid point of view... just one I *no longer possess.* I've seen people who have lost all hope and defiance, who no longer see any point in living, or caring, or fighting. I need it back, desperately, before I lose sight of it forever. It's just out of reach, so close I can almost taste it.  Anyways, the plan. Tie a couple rocks, big ones, about my waist and ankles. Jump, shuffle or something off the pier. If I die, so be it: I die with dignity, in a final act of defiance. If I live, maybe I can recover that spark for just long enough, nourish and protect it till it's a roaring fire again.  edit: Maybe suicidewatch was not the best spot for this, as I want to revitalize my life, not end it?

Every relationship regardless of the kind, consists of a parasitic taker and a sad pathetic pushover giver. It's a world full of sadistic predators and weak prey.

I know that when I die, people won't give a shit, the narcissists in my family will use this as a golden opportunity to suck pity out of everyone around and gain attention.

My thoughts about her brakeup until now have been along the lines of; She is young and doesn't know what she wants yet. And she wants to experiment. I thought give it time and she will come to her senses. We had a very solid relationship, very few fights and we talked about everything that bothered us. A friend of mine (keep in mind that I live in a very small community where everyone knows everyone) told me that he knew that my ex had had sex with someone else. This hit me very hard. Probably a harsh wakeup call: My ex does not want me, and as looking for something better. Since the breakup she has been adamant that we keep contact. Really wants us to be friends. We have hooked up once since the breakup. I asked if she wants us to be fwb. She initially said yes but recently wanted to break off that part of the relationship aswell. This makes me feel even less wanted. I feel replaced somehow ( By the guy who supposedly banged her ). I know that a fwb relationship is in no way exclusive. But I guess that my thoughts made me hopeful.  My realization is that it does not matter if what my friend said is true. The mere thought of my ex being with someone else just crushes me to the core. I honestly thought this was the girl I would spent my life with. She even said so herself. Out of nowhere she wants me to be just a friend. I am not sure what the point of this post is.

I can't understand anything I read so I'd be screwed with philosophy. I'm going to have to drop out. Leave uni. Leave London. Go back to my shitty home town and work a shitty job. Maybe I'll reapply but I doubt I'll be able to return to London and end up in some shitty university town that I hate. I'll also be 21. Won't graduate until 24. Fuck. But maybe I won't because I'll never find interest in anything ever again. I'll just be a burden on my family forever.  All my dreams are dead and I probably will be too soon. ",1,suicide

1910,"A temporary solutionI hate how people say that suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problem. Because yes, the first half is true. Suicide is permanent.  But the second half? It makes me laugh somberly. Everyone in my life who has been suicidal at all, have been suicidal from a young age. And they're in their 20's and 30's. When we talk about suicide, it's something that maybe  they don't think about everyday. Yes, there's bad days and good days. But when they have to fight the rising nothingness that threatens to consume them, it gets harder. You're a little more weary after every fight, year after year, of trying to justify putting yourself through the pain of living. That the color just leaks out of everything and the world turns a little more grey and lifeless.  Yes, there are some temporary problems out there. But for us, our problems stem from something bigger. And they don't always go away. The need to fight is always there, you have to fight to feel something, fight to stay sober, fight to have the energy to go to work or to school or go out to the fucking grocery store. It's a never ending fight, they tell me. Fighting the bad thoughts in your head never stops, and you have to keep going through the motions until it's easier some days. But no matter how much easier it gets, the bad days are there. No matter how much you try to learn to love yourself. The thing working against you is you after all. Therapists tell me the same thing: that I will always struggle with my mental health but I just can't give up! Temporary problems and all that. When they say ""temporary problems"" I wonder how temporary they are. My life will end eventually, so my problems will end too. In the grand scheme of things, yes my problems are incredibly temporary and silly and my struggle is meaningless. Will my whole life be a ceaseless fight? Will I be hurting myself clawing for life for years and years and years before I turn 50 and realize that it wasn't worth the stress and pain of living that long? Of trying that hard? I just turned 21 in July. I think a lot about where I'll be in 10 years, 5 years, hell just even where I'll be when I turn 22 next year.

2056,"Dc is actually a lot better than marvel in many ways. I'll make it clear now that I like both companies equally, I'm simply going to state a few reasons why I think dc has advantages over marvel, a lot of these are my opinions. First off, they are way smarter when it comes to their comics. Comic books are often very hard for new readers to get in to, but dc has actually managed to have an advantage over marvel for a long time now. Unlike marvel, dc does a full scale reset of their universe every few years, in order to allow new readers to hop on and start from the beginning. Marvel has sorta done this before, but they've never done it to the same scale as dc. DC also has better movies, and I know that sounds crazy, but take into account all of dcs animated films, and then compare to the MCU. He'll, compare the dark knight trilogy to any marvel film trilogy or hell the MCU as a whole. Imo, even though marvel releases several movies a year, only one of them is ever anything special. In all honesty, marvel movies are all mostly hype, they're alright films but they aren't anything extraordinary. Then look at something like the Nolan trilogy, or the dc animated movie universe, all of which in my personal opinion are far better than the films in the MCU. Don't get me wrong, phase one and half of two of the marvel films were good, but after that they declined in quality. And also, let's not even mention tv shows, dc wipes the floor with marvel, I mean just look at the dcau. Again, I'm not saying one is better than the other, but both companies have their strengths and weaknesses, and dc deserves a lot more love, and I feel like the dc cinematic universe left a bad impression on people.",0,suicide

Still, though, I find myself stuck in the comfort of silent suffering, which is what held me back from seeking help the first time around, and it's begun to exhaust me. I'm tired of being thrust into happiness and being quickly shrouded in depression a few days later. I don't know who I am, and I can never know what to attribute my emotions to: depression, a bad day, hypomania, a really good day? Such things anger me to a great extent, which is equally distressing, especially when I unrightfully shout at others.

I have slight anger issues and when she yells at me for something small I either get angry or break down into tears.  I have had times where I cut myself after these arguments, which she doesn't know about, and cry my heart out. Today I had a bad day and was trying hard to not go into the kitchen, grab a bottle of random pills, and swallow them all. My mom started getting mad and yelled about how my brother, dad, and I are giving eachother weird and stupid things for Christmas.  I got triggered by how she was yelling at me for something that she is insisting my dad thought of but it was me. She kept saying how he was using dating sites and shit that are expensive and kept ignoring what I was saying.  When she left the room, she closed my door and I just started sobbing. I've been able to quiet my crying so she nor my brother could hear me.  I'm now on my bed crying while physically and mentally straining myself to not go to the kitchen to either slash my wrists with a knife or like I said at the beginning to swallow a bunch of pills. I don't have any razors in my room because I usually cut in the bathroom to avoid any blood on my bed. I dont usually cut to the point it bleeds but just to know that I'm feeling pain and can see the short slashes. I don't have anything to do to sleep from how I feel but I shouldn't be using my phone.

I passed my first two years with averages between 85% and 90% but there is such an infinite amount of information that this exam expects us to know all at one time. The irony is that close to half of it is irrelevant when it comes to being a good physician. I keep forgetting everything that I studied and can't keep anything straight in my head. Everyone else in my class seems so well prepared for this thing. This is the most important test in any doctor's career since it can make or break it. You can't just barely pass this exam and expect to get a residency. You have to do significantly above average in order to get programs to look at your application. If you fail no one will give you a residency and your 8 years of suffering in pre-med and medical school go to waste. I don't see anyway out of this trap.

2170,"Please read this (it's kinda important) Im going to start by saying that a majority of you won't be affected by this post. Im trying to speak to the vocal minority. Also these are my opinions and if you disagree with me I'm sorry. I will talk about numerus things most of which are political and I feel like they need to be said. 1) media portrays that Christians hate the LGBT+ community and as a Christian myself I can say that that is not true. We recognize that it is a sin, say so and move on. For even if  you don't think so you are still a child of God and we shouldn't hate you for it. The people who do tie into my next point. 2) extremists suck. I don't care what group your a part of, these people are everywhere. The worst part about them is that entire groups are defined by them ( think about a ""typical"" leftist or rightist depending on what side you are on). Let's say your a liberal and you have a conservative friend you are are tight and you know he's a conservative but one day some conservative exremists bomb a liberal politician's home. You don't like conservatives and they're all evil. While this is a highly exaggerated example, how do you view the opposite side? 3) this one is more focused on this sub-reddit in particular. Some people on this sub-reddit live in tough homes and they talk about it, which is  a really good thing. It's not a perfect system though. Teenagers can say my parents slapped me and almost immediately people are like call the police or CPS or something. It's kinda the same thing as rape accusations, right? Even if they're false they ruin a man's life( I say man's because women aren't hit as hard or even at all at false rape accusations). Why? Because people judged him and continued to judge him by that. It's the same here. Parents are judged unfairly and without a way to defend themselves. So next time remember that people are innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around. That's all I have for today and I hope you can see where I come from. I'm not the best at putting my thoughts on paper so forgive me on that front. I'll try to answer as many questions as possible to the best of my ability. - a fellow teenager",0,suicide

Being downvoted when you're trying to help is discouraging and brings up a lot of complex trauma.  My plan would most likely be to overdose.
