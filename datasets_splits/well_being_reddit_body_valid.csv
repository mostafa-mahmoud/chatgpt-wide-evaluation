2,"Probably nobody cares but I’m just sooo insanely proud of myself and I really want to talk about it. We had to do a project on energy sources and I did a bunch of research on wind turbines and made a google slide and everything. It was pretty interesting because I actually learned how they worked. I was really nervous when I was presenting because I didn’t know what they would think of my presentation because I thought it wasn’t as good as the other ones. But when I went to present, it’s like my mind went blank and some weird part of my brain took over, I started making jokes, explaining in detail, making up my own sentences without even using my slide project. I opened my presentation with “prepare to get blown away” (because it was on wind turbines) and everyone laughed. And then I went through every slide I had and explained it all way better than I thought I would. I did stumble over a few words but it wasn’t that bad. here’s the best part When I finished, it was all silent for a second and then my science teacher said, “Ashlyn.... that was AWESOME.” And then everyone was clapping. I was the last person to present and the teacher didn’t react that way even for the people who I thought had the best presentations. I’m glad I was wearing a mask because nobody could see how teary I was getting and how much I was grinning. Then, when I looked up my grade, I saw he gave me 10% extra credit. I dont know, I’m just soooooo happy. I’ve never been this proud of myself before.",0,well_being_reddit_body

4,"Sometimes I get really dumb, and it bothers me. I’ll have jumbled thoughts, ideas don’t move continuously. I have ADHD, but this feels different. My normal struggles with focus leave me intelligent; I basically lose the ability to do anything that requires thought, even if it’s something I’ve done many times before, during the “dumb periods.” Does this make any sense? I don’t think this has always happened to me, so I’m curious about other peoples’ experiences. I don’t think it’s a medicine thing because I’ve been on this cocktail for a year, and it only happens rarely. For reference, I’m on Lamictal and lexapro.",1,well_being_reddit_body
5,"I guess for context I'm 16 years old. The post kind of says all of it. I just cant relax. For about a month, I have gone one full year of literal, constant, stress. And by ""constant stress"". I mean from the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to sleep. And there's very little rest from it. Its very exhausting(as you can imagine)and has taken a certain toll on my mental health, and if it hasn't taken one on my physical health it will at some point. It does have a lot to do with my emotional health, which is pretty bad to say the least(loooooot of personal insecurity for a large part of it). I have been going to both a therapist and a counselor, and mostly my therapist has been the one guiding me more through the stress. This includes having less fear with my interests, and trying to sort out what aspects of my life and personality I have control over, and what aspects I do not. And I think trying to know how to work with myself. But I just want to relax. I just want to collapse and finally feel relaxed. It doesn't help that I'm looking for what personally fulfills me and everything that I think is supposed to help me relieve stress makes me even more stress, because of the aforementioned insecurity. Please, if anyone can help me with this, thank you I'll edit this as I find mistakes or have things to add in, if you guys need more info just ask, and also I think in general I'm very sleep deprived so that could have something to do with it.

7,"Everyone says “try harder” or “I know you can do it” and all I wanna say to them is shut the living fuck up. I can’t try harder and I can’t do it, if I could I obviously would. I know they care but they’re also being inconsiderate by assuming I’m just choosing to fail my classes.

9,"Hi everyone just wanted to dump some thoughts out. So I’m taking organic chemistry over the summer! I took ochem 1 earlier in the summer and managed to get an A, however, I’m in ochem 2 now and it’s REALLY kicking my ass. I’m so stressed about it. Not only that, summer session won’t end until August 15th and my current apartment lease ends on July 31st. My next lease at the new apartment doesn’t start until August 23rd & they won’t let me move in early. Therefore I had nowhere to stay for the two weeks of August and I didn’t have a friend that had room available for me to crash at. I booked a hotel last minute with my roommate (she’s in the same situation bc she’s taking ochem 2 as well) and we have to move out in a few days. So now I’m stressed about moving out and making sure everything is in tip top shape so I can get my deposit back right. I’m also stressed because I won’t have room in the hotel for all my stuff and I wouldn’t want to have it sitting in my car for so long. I’m racking my brains trying to find people to ask if I could store some stuff at their place. I also have my ochem 2 exam on Monday and I’m barely grasping the concepts. Not only that, my depression has been creeping back due to some repressed trauma resurfacing so it’s just made everything ten times harder and honestly just more magnified. I was taking everything down from the walls and was using this tube of some paste that my dad gave me to patch the holes from nails/screws. I had already finished patching up most of the holes until I finally read the tube and turns out that it’s not made for walls. I don’t know anything about construction-y kind of stuff so I started freaking out. I guess that that was my tipping point because I was really sitting on my floor having a crisis and crying over holes in the wall. Fast forward to now! I’ve gotten the right paste needed to patch the holes and have finished going over them. In retrospect, everything is just funny at this point. Like I was really sitting there crying about holes in the wall HAHA",1,well_being_reddit_body

Now I wake up everyday at around 3PM because I can't sleep at night until around 4AM no matter how much or what medications I can take. I also feel tremendously guilty when I get down because I remember all the people in the world with disabilities who would do anything to be in my predicament because it pales in comparison. I also feel like outside of my parents I have none to talk to, not even necessarily about my struggles but just about everyday stuff. I have friends but they never seem to want to do anything.

21,"I don't know if this is stress or more built up anger. My dad and mom got divorced many years ago when I was kind of young. My dad started dating about 2 or 3 years later and his gf was pretty nice, I was still pretty young so I didn't really like her but I look back now and she was pretty nice. They broke up about 3 years later and a couple years later he started dating somebody again. They've been dating for 3 years now maybe, at first I didn't really care but I'm older now so I have more emotions and she just moved in and I hate to say this, but I really don't like her at all, she's not mean or toxic or anything but she acts like a 5 year old everyday and never takes no for an answer. ""You want to go on a walk"" ""no"" then she bugs me for 15 minutes trying to get me to go on a walk when I don't like walks and have said no plenty of times. There are many other things that I don't like but she can also kind of be a bitch, I just went on a vacation for a week with my dad, her and her family and it's the last day, we're about to drive out. We have a dog so we put a cover on the back and when we got in to drive we realized it was backwards so I couldn't buckle, she looked back and said, ""you know Adam some things are important and you need to realize"", I said ""I know"" And then she kept going on a rant while I fixed it and the urge to tell her to stfu almost went above my limit, I have never told anyone to stfu or really shut up but it's been two days in a row where I almost told her to stfu. I'm thinking about getting a stress ball because she really makes me pissed, more and more recently since she's working from home and is always around so I could get a stress ball to get the anger out.

I sought help twice before and the doctor hurt me a lot more than he possibly knew. He was focused on my sexuality. He insinuated that being gay was abnormal (not directly) and that I was feeling bad due to uncertainty.

Over the past few months, I did well, I stayed positive and on path, I was suppose to move to a different state but I had to put those plans on the backburner for now due to a financial situation I hope resolves by October.

I can hardly walk. The only person I had was my roommate who was also my best friend. But he wasn’t really there for me. But I eventually started growing feelings after awhile. Then past week he told me he is talking to another girl. Leaving me hurt. I even told him how I felt. But nothing in return. But he’s worth waiting for so I want to wait, so that adds more stress. On top of all that, my dad who is in remission from cancer isn’t doing well. My health hasn’t been the best either. I have epilepsy and suffer from migraines. More episodes, etc. Now I have a heart condition that is scary. And the past 15 minutes I’ve gotten two calls. One from my neurologist saying that since I’ve been having more episodes, may lose my already restricted license. The other from my cardiologist saying the heart condition is worse. I really hope to god 2021 will be better",1,well_being_reddit_body

There are times where he drives recklessly, yells, gets angry at the dogs, slams things, or generally expresses his anger outwardly. He's scared me on multiple occasions, yet he is simultaneously my only source of emotional support. I was in denial about it for a long time and didn't tell anyone (not even my therapist) out of fear that they would make me break up with him or tell me to leave. He apologized for his behavior and has committed to going to therapy but I'm not sure if it's smart to get back into the relationship (as it takes time to heal/change). Each person I've talked to has given contradicting advice, although most voted to have a clean breakup. Many have pointed out the red flags and it's making me second guess a lot of the relationship (was it manipulation? Was I stuck in a submissive role?). I think it's a mix of a lot of different things... (or am I still in denial about how toxic it was?). My logic is that if he could control it, he would have stopped, meaning he needs time to work on it. Thus, it would be illogical to jump back into a relationship without giving him enough time to work on himself in therapy. My therapist recommended taking some time apart, although that can translate into many different things (distance? a break? a breakup? etc).

It was a classic story, she got into college in a different state, I couldn't afford to go to college yet, we planned to stay together long distance and it lasted about 3 months. Breaking up with her ruined both of us at the time of course for a few months, that first person you fall in love with does a number on you. I was pretty miserable for a while. For years when I thought about it, it would make me a little sad. Especially if I was single at the time. Then I really never thought about it at all. This was probably the first time I thought about her in as long as I can remember, maybe years (I'm 30 now). This time though I didn't feel sad at all, everything I remembered was a happy memory. The first time we kissed, which was the first time either of us had kissed anyone. Doing absolutely everything together. Sneaking out just to see each other for a few minutes. Climbing an old fire tower in our town, laying out in a field under the stars together. Falling asleep together for the first time. Carrying her around for no reason. Planning all the trips we would never end up going on together. Also, just that overwhelming feeling of wanting to be near someone, and the joy I'd feel when her car would pull up or when she would walk out of her front door to meet me. It's all just nice fun stuff, and it doesn't really matter to me anymore that it didn't work out, and I don't really remember the painful part of it ending. I'm just glad it happened, it was probably the best part of my childhood and young adult years and you can't get that back.

Well i went into a dangerous heart arrhythmia that afternoon and had to go to the hospital where my 17 year old athletic self almost went into cardiac arrest as i went into Vfib. I had a heart ablation the day after and missed all of my tests. If i wouldn’t of gone to the ER that night i would of gone into Vfib while studying and died within minutes(Sudden Cardiac Death). My teachers are all understanding but now i have to go back to school tomorrow and figure out how to fit 6 1-2 hour tests in 55 minute class periods. I don’t want to miss class tomorrow i need one day back to school after missing three weeks due to winter break and recovery. Is there anyone who has missed Midterms or Finals who came up with a good makeup plan. I just need a day or two to go over stuff and have a normal routine as some of my classes changed over the semester.

With this back and forth of restrictions and uncertainties, many people seem to just be so sick of it and have started to ignore the restrictions and hanging out as normal. Working in healthcare, especially as a frontline worker, I have a hard time doing that. I certainly don't want to be the person to be a super spreader since I work at multiple sites. They typically have gatherings that involve drinking and ending up indoors. I feel like such a prude for wanting to follow the guidelines and just have outdoor gatherings so I don't end up going.

My point of this post though wasn’t to just rant about me, I was just wondering if anyone else with depression/depressive disorders goes through this with their work life and what was your experience like. Did it help a lot once you left? I’ve asked for help but my boss told me that this job is “sink or swim”.

I remember in 3rd grade he was crying on the floor to me not to leave. We left and didn’t come back cause it was bad. He tried to follow but ended up homeless. On Christmas Eve when I was in college trying to build my life, he killed himself. He jumped off a bridge in the winter in Jersey. Someone saw him jump and he was recused but in ICU brain dead. At 23 years old I was the next of kin and doctors made me decide to pull the plug and they told me, “he sent a message of what he wanted.” So I did it. It kills my heart everyday. 10 years later my best friend broke up with a boyfriend and was feeling terrible. I was convinced she was amazing and enough to find someone else and wanted to distract her by saying let’s go to a psychic to prove that you will find someone else. I did a reading too (super skeptical- my first reading and I thought it would be fun- not serious) and she said to me I see suicide in your life. I replied, it was as my father.

People don't bring their cat here for booster shots. They go to regular clinics for that. Yesterday I walk in and find a box of chocolate with a note on it from a recent client thanking me for what I do. I remember her dog. Strongly hypocalcemic seizure patient who did not make it. But despite that the client found it prudent to thank me anyway and that actually made me tear up some. I shared the treats with my staff because it's not just me here and they also deserve it. I just wanted to share because it really did give me a boost. I actually really enjoy what I do and I've worked really hard to get here and it's good to know people actually appreciate it.,0,well_being_reddit_body

I know it was my choice, and I should no complain about it. However, living in a new country, learning a new language, and adapting myself to a new culture have been challenging. I realized my mood has been constantly shifting more often than before. I could be totally okay but irrationally emotional when I experience something that remind me certain past feelings. I realized I need help. But how? I am alone here without genuine friends close by. I don’t think talking to my old friends or colleagues could help cus it puts me in a vulnerable position where I’d feel uncomfortable. I don’t think I need to seek for a pro therapy yet but I definitely need to feel cared, heard and supported. I started to wonder if there’re million of people like me who feel lonely and helpless lightly from time to time. Recently, I got connected with a person over the internet. We didn’t know much about each other but we just started this short check-in everyday somehow. I felt there is a hope and need to keep going cus I want to report my daily life briefly to this person. Sometime my day is bad and sometime isn’t. I don’t feel shame if I say I procrastinate today to this person.

I find myself more concerned with my friends lives, comparing myself to what they’re doing, and checking my phone to ensure I’m in constant communication with someone but not actually living my own life. I’m wildly indecisive and influenced (for example switched from an in person class to an online class because of fear of a professor and conversations I had with someone, forgetting that I only wanted to be in school if it was in person. I use social media as a way to self harm, watching others live the lives I want to (I know more about what my ex and their friend group is doing then how to solve my problems). I just feel so consumed by others and I don’t know how to turn it off. I feel as though I don’t have interests anymore, only consuming what’s recommended.

This has worked well for me, with minimal hurt from hoping too much. But. I don't need to do that anymore. I don't necessarily know why, but since June, I've been looking forward to waking up every morning. Actually, I know why. It's because the belief that I had to die to feel at peace has been proven wrong. Completely wrong. It's so reassuring to know it is possible to be happy and alive at the same time. For the past few years, I've been wallowing in my depression. I feared death but at the same time craved it. So, as foolish as I was. I tried. Failed. And regretted backing out for about 8 months. Mainly because I was now on people's watchlist. I had a fear of pills for a while. Just the thought of them made my stomach twist and turn. I would constantly lay in bed, stay up late to wake up minutes before the bus. I was convinced that there was nothing left for me. So I acted impulsively. If I was gonna go. I was going to go out with a bang. I fractured my hand. Had a scrap with my Bastard of a Parent. Attempted. Planned another. But at the same time, I desperately hung on. I didn't really want to die. No one really does. A close friend of mine dragged me out. I will always admire and appreciate her for having the patience to deal with me. She let me stay. And I've realized, her family is the polar opposite of mine. Calm and quiet majority of the times. Full of fun. Laughter. They don't raise hands or lace poison in their words. I didn't know that this was possible. For me to be happy for more than an hour. For me to be a part of a household where my contribution is appreciated and needed. Where my mental illness is not a myth. Where my feelings don't have to be locked away. I feel so validated and unconditionally loved. I want to start getting professional help. To better myself.

Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections. Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked. Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself. EDIT okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that. But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this.

I make lots of small mistakes, forget things, have constant headaches, can’t remember what I’ve done, etc. My brain basically feels like it’s broken. My boss said to be easy on myself, but to make sure that I’m doing good work and contributing value to the organization, I know she cares that I’m struggling but also has high expectations. She’s frustrated and I am too, but I’m truly at a loss of what to do. It’s a small team so asking to take on fewer responsibilities doesn’t seem like an option, and I’d feel selfish doing that so soon into my new position, but I don’t feel like I can keep doing this. Any advice? Either for helping with focus or talking with my boss. Thank you!",1,well_being_reddit_body

341,"Hello everyone! I’m currently in my last year of high school and I’m having a hard time dealing with it. I live in Eastern Europe and in my country we have those big exams at the end of high school that are supposed to evaluate all the knowledge you’ve gained since grade 1. Two exams are mandatory - one in literature and the other one, you can choose the subject yourself. For my second one I chose physics and I’m pretty confident with that. However, literature has always been a huge burden on mine and I find it extremely difficult to prepare for that exam. I am beyond angered constantly that I have to deal with that subject - I do understand that literature increases your knowledge about the world and teaches you how to support your arguments, but the emphasis that is given on that exam by my teacher and parents is too big and I can’t do anything but hate the guts out of it. Now, me being the perfect student, raised by perfectionist parents, I can’t even think about having low grades on that exam. I study in a “highly respected” school, where teachers can be pure evil to you. I also have to prepare for my university entrance exams and work on a project of mine, which stress me out even more. At the end of the day, I feel so drained out and like I’ve achieved nothing, even though I have spent the whole day in school and preparing for exams. I’ve started feeling physically unwell. I used to work out a lot but now I don’t have the energy to go out of my bed. My blood pressure is very low and I’ve gained weight. I’ve given up to emotional eating one too many times. I wanna shine for prom. I want to look my best at the end of the school year and feel my best when real life hits me. But I’m scared that school will drain me out too much. This is more of a rant post because I know the only way to fix the situation is by resting more. I just can’t let myself rest. My mind is constantly busy with my work.

Maybe it's just that every day is the same, and I honestly have nothing to look forward to. I have no friends and a family that I feel no connection to and gives no support. School is killing me and I'm worried that I may not graduate. Many personal problems also wear me down. I'm currently drinking coffee because I hate this weird feeling of being tired yet not really. Throughout the day, I constantly feel the need to sleep, and even when I do, it doesn't help my energy. Maybe I'm just not consistent, but I've slept a lot and no longer feel the need to. Sleeping is now just an annoyance that I use simply to transition into the next day easily. I roll around my bed uncomfortably for long periods of time and the rising temperatures aren't helping. I eventually fall asleep and wake up feeling like garbage no matter when I fell asleep or how long I've slept.

I dont care if im pretty or smart or loved. Most of the time im passive aggressive with my beloved ppl I dont care if i stay a whole month without her meeting friends or ppl sometimes I get these episodes where I’m panicking, tachycardia, cant think straight or decide anything, Stressed stomach where i would vomit any food .. too scared and fragile that i would think of going down stairs and get hit by a cat and die.. i reached that point I always hated, Nothing matters and Im done fighting for myself.",1,well_being_reddit_body

410,"​ hello. i'm 14, and i feel that i am experiencing a never-ending cycle of existential crisis. ever since i was a child i have been questioning everything in my life. but now, within the last three years it has really been hitting me. everyday feels like a constant battle with my own mind, my social problems extend beyond what other people think, i am being held back by the things i tell myself and i can't help it. i procrastinate in all aspects of my life and i just don't want to but i can't control it. i have different compulsions i can't explain. i see all of these people around me happy, without these things on their minds. i wish that i could be them. i am so lucky & i've been blessed, i live in the ideal situation but i can't make use of it. clichè, but i'm scared of growing up. i don't ever want to age. why can't this be. i don't want to see loved ones go, i just want everything to be the fucking same. i am filled with hate, angst and judgement towards others, but i hate to see it handed back to me. these problems that i have make the future seem more bleak every day. when my parents and family goes, the pain will not amount to anything i will ever experience otherwise. apart of me will die. i love them so much, but socially i can't express this to them. i'm sorry for everything i've done wrong. what is every decision we make, every achievement, every mistake all for? is everything for nothing? why are we all here? is it by chance, by luck, or by God's will? i've yet to know. i have so much to learn, i don't want to die but i am ready to go, i know that it will come, because i have faith in the fact that God is pulling the strings and he is making me experiencing these things. so i will continue to live each day as it comes, i will continue to stare into my ceiling for hours on end asking why and i will continue to live, hoping that joy will fill my life again. ​ all i need is the anchor unbound from my heart and mind, it will be the day i find out what this is all for.",1,well_being_reddit_body

457,"Hey guys, so.. i don't actually know how to tell this, i won't bore you with the whole story. basically, some months ago, i wake up because of my girlfriends phone, it was her gym coach who, i found out, she was having sex with. i stare at the phone in disbelief, i couldn't believe it. and now that? i woke my girlfriend up, yell at her, and ask her to leave. Half an hour later, my father calls me and told me to come to the hospital. It turns out, my mother (who had been fighting cancer for almost a year) stopped breathing. A couple hours later, she dies. I didn't feel bad about it for a while, but now, been isolated i feel really lonely, sad and heartbroken. i have no one to talk to about this. Also, i now find it difficult to connect to other women because of trust issues. I wish i could hug my mother in this situation.",1,well_being_reddit_body
